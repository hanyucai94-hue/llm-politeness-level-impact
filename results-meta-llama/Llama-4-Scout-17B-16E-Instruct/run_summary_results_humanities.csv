The argument given is:
1. J ≡ ~K
2. J ∨ L
3. ~K
∴ L

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
- Premise 1: J ≡ ~K (J if and only if not K)
- Premise 2: J ∨ L (J or L)
- Premise 3: ~K (not K)
- Conclusion: L

## 3: Construct a truth table for the premises and conclusion
To determine validity, we need to consider all possible truth values of J, K, and L.

## 4: Analyze Premise 1 (J ≡ ~K)
This is true when J and ~K have the same truth value (both true or both false).

## 5: Analyze Premise 2 (J ∨ L) and Premise 3 (~K)
Premise 2 is false only when both J and L are false. Premise 3 is true when K is false.

## 6: Determine the conditions for the argument to be valid
The argument is valid if there's no row in the truth table where all premises are true but the conclusion (L) is false.

## 7: Evaluate option C as a potential counterexample
Option C suggests a counterexample when J is true and K and L are false. Let's evaluate:
- If J is true, K is false, and L is false:
- Premise 1 (J ≡ ~K): True because J is true and ~K is true (since K is false).
- Premise 2 (J ∨ L): True because J is true.
- Premise 3 (~K): True because K is false.
- Conclusion (L): False.

## 8: Conclusion on validity and counterexample
Given that we found a scenario where all premises can be true and the conclusion false, the argument is invalid. We need to verify if the scenario in option C indeed serves as a counterexample.

If J is true and K and L are false, then:
- J ≡ ~K is false because J is true and ~K is true, but this matches the ""if and only if"" condition actually since ~K is true (K is false), this is true.
- J ∨ L is true because J is true.
- ~K is true because K is false.
- L is false.

## 9: Detailed evaluation for J=True, K=False, L=False
- J ≡ ~K: True (since J=True and ~K=True)

The given argument is: (G ≡ H) · ~I, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) / G. To assess its validity, we first need to understand what it's saying. The premises are (G ≡ H) · ~I and ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), and the conclusion is G.

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
- The first premise, (G ≡ H) · ~I, means that G is equivalent to H and I is false.
- The second premise, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), can be simplified using the associative property of disjunction to ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I.
- The conclusion is G.

## 3: Construct a truth table
To determine the validity of the argument, we need to construct a truth table for all possible combinations of G, H, and I.

## 4: Analyze possible truth values for G, H, and I
There are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations for the truth values of G, H, and I.

## 5: Evaluate the argument's validity
Without drawing the actual table due to format constraints, we evaluate:
- For the argument to be valid, there must be no row where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.

## 6: Consider the options given for invalidity
- Option B suggests a counterexample when H and I are true and G is false.
- Option C suggests a counterexample when H is true and I and G are false.
- Option D suggests a counterexample when H, I, and G are false.

## 7: Assess option B
If H and I are true and G is false, then:
- (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent (G is false, H is true).
- ~I is false because I is true.
- So, (G ≡ H) · ~I is false, making the first premise false.

## 8: Assess option C
If H is true and I and G are false, then:
- (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent.
- ~I is true because I is false.
- So, (G ≡ H) · ~I is false, making the first premise false.

## 9: Assess option D
If H, I, and G are false, then:
- (G ≡ H) is true because both are false.
- ~I is true because I is false.
- So, (G ≡ H) · ~I is true.
- ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) becomes true ∨ (true ∨ false) = true.
- The conclusion G is false.

## 10: Determine validity or counterexample
Given the assessment, we can see that if G, H, and I are all false, the premises can be true while the conclusion is false.

The argument given is: (G ≡ H) · ~I, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) / G. To assess its validity, we need to construct a truth table.

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
First premise: (G ≡ H) · ~I. This means G is equivalent to H and I is false.
Second premise: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I). This means either G is false or (H is false or I is true).
Conclusion: G.

## 3: Construct a truth table
A full truth table for three variables (G, H, I) has 2^3 = 8 rows.

## 4: Evaluate the first premise (G ≡ H) · ~I
G ≡ H is true when G and H have the same truth value (both true or both false). ~I is true when I is false.

## 5: Evaluate the second premise ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)
This is true if G is false or if H is false or I is true.

## 6: Determine the conditions for the argument to be valid
The argument is valid if there is no row in the truth table where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.

## 7: Analyze potential counterexamples
Without drawing the actual table, we can consider the options given:
- For B (Invalid. Counterexample when H and I are true and G is false): If G is false, H is true, and I is true, then (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent, making the first premise false. The second premise ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) would be true because ~G is true. The conclusion G is false. This could potentially be a counterexample but let's check if it fits the premises.

## 8: Check option B
If G is false, H is true, and I is true, the first premise (G ≡ H) · ~I is false because ~I is false (I is true), making the whole premise false regardless of G ≡ H. The second premise ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is true because ~G is true. The conclusion G is false. This scenario makes the first premise false, so it's not a counterexample.

## 9: Check option C
If H is true and I and G are false, then (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent, making the first premise false. The second premise ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is true because ~G is true. The conclusion G is false. This makes the first premise false, so it's not a counterexample.

## 10: Check option D
If H, I, and G are false, then (G ≡ H) is true because G and H are equivalent (both false), and ~I is true. So, the first premise (G ≡ H) · ~I is true. The second premise ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is true because ~G is true. The conclusion G is false. This scenario makes both premises true and the conclusion false.

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
Premise 1: (G ≡ H) · ~I
Premise 2: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)
Conclusion: G

## 3: Construct the truth table
Given that each of G, H, and I can be true (T) or false (F), there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

## 4: Evaluate Premise 1
(G ≡ H) is true if G and H have the same truth value (both T or both F). ~I is true if I is false.

## 5: Evaluate Premise 2
~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is true if ~G is true or if ~H ∨ I is true.

## 6: Determine validity
Without drawing the actual table due to format constraints, we analyze:
- For the argument to be valid, whenever both premises are true, the conclusion must be true.
- A counterexample occurs when both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

## 7: Analyze potential counterexamples
Given the options:
- B: Invalid. Counterexample when H and I are true and G is false.
- C: Invalid. Counterexample when H is true and I and G are false.
- D: Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and G are false.

## 8: Assess option B
If H and I are true and G is false, then (G ≡ H) is false because G and H do not have the same truth value, making Premise 1 false. Thus, B may not directly serve as a counterexample without checking Premise 2.

## 9: Assess option C
If H is true and I and G are false, then (G ≡ H) is false because G and H do not have the same truth value, making Premise 1 false.

## 10: Assess option D
If H, I, and G are false, then (G ≡ H) is true because G and H have the same truth value, and ~I is true, making Premise 1 true. For Premise 2: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) = T ∨ (F ∨ F) = T ∨ F = T. The conclusion G is false.

- For C (Invalid. Counterexample when H is true and I and G are false): If G and I are false and H is true, then (G ≡ H) · ~I is false because G ≡ H is false, so it's not a counterexample.
- For D (Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and G are false): If G, H, and I are false, then (G ≡ H) is true because G ≡ H is true when both are false, and ~I is true. The first premise is true. The second premise ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I is true because ~G and ~H are true. However, the conclusion G is false.

## 6: Determine validity or find a counterexample

## 7: Specific evaluation
Given the complexity of manually typing out the entire truth table here, let's consider critical rows:
- When G, H, and I are all false, (G ≡ H) is true, ~I is true, so (G ≡ H) · ~I is true. ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I is true because ~G and ~H are true. However, G is false.

Option D suggests a counterexample when H, I, and G are false. Let's verify if this makes both premises true and the conclusion false.

## 9: Verification of Option D
If G, H, and I are false:
- (G ≡ H) is true because both are false.

The argument given is:
1. J ≡ ~K
2. J ∨ L
3. ~K
∴ L

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
- Premise 1: J ≡ ~K (J if and only if not K)
- Premise 2: J ∨ L (J or L)
- Premise 3: ~K (not K)
- Conclusion: L

## 3: Construct a truth table for the premises and conclusion
To determine validity, we need to consider all possible truth values of J, K, and L.

## 4: Analyze Premise 1 (J ≡ ~K)
This is true when J and ~K have the same truth value (both true or both false).

## 5: Analyze Premise 2 (J ∨ L) and Premise 3 (~K)
Premise 2 is false only when both J and L are false. Premise 3 is true when K is false.

## 6: Determine the conditions for the argument to be valid
The argument is valid if there's no row in the truth table where all premises are true but the conclusion (L) is false.

## 7: Evaluate the options with the truth table in mind
Without drawing the actual table, we can reason:
- If ~K is true (K is false), then from J ≡ ~K, J must be true (since ~K is true).
- With J being true, J ∨ L is automatically true regardless of L's value.
- Given ~K and J ≡ ~K, if K is false, J must be true, which makes J ∨ L true. The conclusion L's truth value depends on the specific values of J, K, and L.

## 8: Consider the options for invalidity
- Option B: If J and K are true and L is false, then ~K is false, which contradicts premise 3.
- Option C: If J is true and K and L are false, then ~K is true, J ≡ ~K holds (since J is true and ~K is true), J ∨ L is true (because J is true), but L is false.
- Option D: If K is true and J and L are false, then ~K is false, which contradicts premise 3.

## 9: Identify the correct answer
Given the analysis, we look for a scenario where all premises are true, and the conclusion is false.

The best answer is C."
humanities,24,Rude,2,0,C,A,"## Step 1: Understand the argument structure
The argument given is:
1. J ≡ ~K
2. J ∨ L
3. ~K

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
- J ≡ ~K means J is true if and only if K is false.
- J ∨ L means J or L (or both) are true.
- ~K means K is false.
The conclusion is L.

## 3: Construct a truth table for the premises and conclusion
To determine validity, we need a truth table with all possible combinations of J, K, and L.

| J | K | L | ~K | J ≡ ~K | J ∨ L |
|---|---|---|----|--------|-------|
| T | T | T | F  | F      | T     |

| F | F | F | T  | F      | F     |

## 4: Evaluate the argument's validity
The argument is valid if there's no row where all premises are true but the conclusion (L) is false.

## 5: Identify premises and conclusion in the table
Premises: J ≡ ~K, J ∨ L, ~K
Conclusion: L

## 6: Analyze rows for validity
Looking at rows where ~K is true (since ~K is a premise), we focus on rows 3, 4, 7, and 8.

## 7: Detailed analysis of relevant rows
- Row 3: J=T, K=F, L=T; ~K=T, J≡~K=T, J∨L=T; L=T. All true.
- Row 4: J=T, K=F, L=F; ~K=T, J≡~K=T, J∨L=T; L=F. Premises true, conclusion false.

## 8: Conclusion on validity
Since there's a row (Row 4) where all premises are true but L is false, the argument is invalid.

## 9: Identify the counterexample
Row 4 gives a counterexample: J is true, K is false, and L is false.

## 10: Match the counterexample to the given options
- J is true, K is false, and L is false matches option C.

There are 2^3 = 8 combinations:
1. J=T, K=T, L=T
2. J=T, K=T, L=F
3. J=T, K=F, L=T
4. J=T, K=F, L=F
5. J=F, K=T, L=T
6. J=F, K=T, L=F
7. J=F, K=F, L=T
8. J=F, K=F, L=F

## 5: Evaluate the premises and conclusion for each combination
We evaluate J ≡ ~K, J ∨ L, ~K, and L for each combination.

## 6: Determine the validity of the argument
The argument is invalid if there's a row where all premises are true but the conclusion is false.

## 7: Analyze specific rows for counterexamples
Given the nature of the question, let's analyze critical rows:
- For J ≡ ~K to be true, J and K must have opposite truth values.
- ~K being true means K must be false.

## 8: Evaluate option C as a potential counterexample
If J is true and K and L are false, then:
- J ≡ ~K is false because J is true and ~K is true, but this doesn't directly help without calculating.
- Let's calculate: If J=T, K=F, L=F, then:
  - J ≡ ~K is T because ~K is T.
  - J ∨ L is T because J is T.
  - ~K is T.
  - L is F.

## 9: Conclusion on validity
Given J=T, K=F, L=F:
- All premises are true (T, T, T).
- The conclusion L is false.

The given argument is: (G ≡ H) · ~I, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) / G. To assess its validity, we first need to understand what it's saying. The premises are (G ≡ H) · ~I and ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), and the conclusion is G.

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
- The first premise, (G ≡ H) · ~I, means that G is equivalent to H and I is false.
- The second premise, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), can be simplified using the associative property of disjunction to ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I.
- The conclusion is G.

## 3: Construct a truth table
To determine the validity of the argument, we need to construct a truth table for all possible combinations of G, H, and I.

## 4: Analyze possible truth values for G, H, and I
There are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations for the truth values of G, H, and I.

## 5: Evaluate the argument's validity
Without drawing the actual table due to format constraints, we evaluate:
- For the argument to be valid, there must be no row where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.

## 6: Consider the options given for invalidity
- Option B suggests a counterexample when H and I are true and G is false.
- Option C suggests a counterexample when H is true and I and G are false.
- Option D suggests a counterexample when H, I, and G are false.

## 7: Assess option B
If H and I are true and G is false, then:
- (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent (G is false, H is true).
- ~I is false because I is true.
- So, (G ≡ H) · ~I is false.
- This makes the first premise false, which doesn't necessarily help in finding a counterexample since a false premise can still lead to a true conclusion in a valid argument.

## 8: Assess option C
If H is true and I and G are false, then:
- (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent.
- ~I is true because I is false.
- So, (G ≡ H) · ~I is false.
- The second premise ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) becomes true ∨ (false ∨ false) = true.
- The conclusion G is false.

## 9: Assess option D
If H, I, and G are false, then:
- (G ≡ H) is true because both are false.
- ~I is true because I is false.
- So, (G ≡ H) · ~I is true.
- The second premise ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) becomes true ∨ (true ∨ false) = true.
- The conclusion G is false.

## 10: Determine validity or counterexample
Given the assessments, we look for a scenario where both premises are true, and the conclusion is false.

The best answer is D."
humanities,123,Friendly,2,0,D,A,"## Step 1: Understand the argument structure
The argument given is: (G ≡ H) · ~I, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) / G. To assess its validity, we need to construct a truth table.

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
First premise: (G ≡ H) · ~I. This means G is equivalent to H and I is false.
Second premise: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I). This means either G is false or (H is false or I is true).
Conclusion: G.

## 3: Construct a truth table
We need to consider all possible combinations of G, H, and I (which are 2^3 = 8 combinations) and evaluate the truth of the premises and the conclusion for each combination.

## 4: Evaluate the argument
Without showing the full table, let's analyze:
- For the argument to be valid, whenever both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.
- The first premise, (G ≡ H) · ~I, is true when G = H and I is false.
- The second premise, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), is true if either G is false or H is false or I is true.

## 5: Consider potential counterexamples
A counterexample would be a row in the truth table where both premises are true, but the conclusion (G) is false.

## 6: Analyze option B
Option B suggests a counterexample when H and I are true and G is false. If G is false, H is true, and I is true, then:
- (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent.
- Thus, the first premise is false, making this not a counterexample.

## 7: Analyze option C
Option C suggests a counterexample when H is true and I and G are false. If G and I are false and H is true:
- (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent.
- The first premise is false, so this is not a counterexample.

## 8: Analyze option D
Option D suggests a counterexample when H, I, and G are false. If G, I are false and H is false:
- (G ≡ H) is true because G and H are equivalent (both false).
- ~I is true because I is false.
- So, the first premise is true.
- For the second premise, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) = true ∨ (true ∨ false) = true.
- The conclusion G is false.

We need to consider all possible combinations of G, H, and I (which are 2^3 = 8 combinations) and evaluate the truth of the premises and the conclusion for each combination.

## 4: Evaluate the argument's validity
Without showing the entire table due to format constraints, we evaluate the argument's validity based on the rules of propositional logic.

## 5: Identify a counterexample if the argument is invalid
If there's a row in the truth table where both premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that row represents a counterexample.

## 6: Analyze option B
Option B suggests a counterexample when H and I are true and G is false. Let's see if this makes both premises true and the conclusion false.

## 7: Test option B's scenario
If G is false, H is true, and I is true, then:
1. (G ≡ H) · ~I is false because ~I is false.
2. ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is true because ~G is true.
3. G is false.

## 8: Analyze option C
Option C suggests a counterexample when H is true and I and G are false.

## 9: Test option C's scenario
If G is false, H is true, and I is false, then:
1. (G ≡ H) · ~I is false because G ≡ H is false.
So, option C doesn't provide a valid counterexample.

## 10: Analyze option D
Option D suggests a counterexample when H, I, and G are false.

## 11: Test option D's scenario
If G, H, and I are false, then:
1. (G ≡ H) · ~I is true because G ≡ H is true (both false) and ~I is true.
2. ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is true because ~G is true.
3. G is false.

## 12: Conclusion on validity and counterexample
Given the tests, we can determine the argument's validity and find a counterexample if it exists.

The best answer is D."
humanities,123,Rude,2,0,D,A,"## Step 1: Understand the argument structure
The argument given is: (G ≡ H) · ~I, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) / G. To assess its validity, we first need to understand what it's saying. The premises are (G ≡ H) · ~I and ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), and the conclusion is G.

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
- The first premise, (G ≡ H) · ~I, means that G is equivalent to H and I is false.
- The second premise, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), can be simplified using the associative property of disjunction to ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I.
- The conclusion is G.

## 3: Construct a truth table
To determine the validity of the argument, we need to construct a truth table for all possible combinations of G, H, and I.

## 4: Analyze possible truth values for G, H, and I
There are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations for the truth values of G, H, and I.

## 5: Evaluate the argument for each combination
We will evaluate (G ≡ H) · ~I and ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) to see if they lead to G.

## 6: Determine validity or find a counterexample
If there's any row in the truth table where both premises are true but the conclusion (G) is false, the argument is invalid, and that row represents a counterexample.

## 7: Specific evaluation
Given the complexity of manually typing out the entire truth table here, let's consider critical rows:
- For G ≡ H to be true, G and H must have the same truth value.
- ~I means I must be false.

## 8: Consider a key scenario
If I is false, ~I is true. For (G ≡ H) · ~I to be true, G ≡ H must also be true. 

## 9: Evaluate with I = False
With I = False, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) simplifies to ~G ∨ ~H because ~H ∨ False = ~H.

## 10: Look for counterexamples based on given choices
Let's examine choice D: Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and G are false.
- If G, H, and I are false, then (G ≡ H) is true because both are false, and ~I is true, so (G ≡ H) · ~I is true.
- For ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), ~G is true (since G is false), so ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is true regardless of ~H ∨ I.
- However, G is false, which would be a counterexample.

The answer is D."

- For ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), since G is false, ~G is true, making the whole disjunction true regardless of ~H ∨ I.

humanities,24,Neutral,3,0,C,A,"## Step 1: Understand the argument structure
The argument given is:
1. J ≡ ~K
2. J ∨ L
3. ~K
∴ L

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
- Premise 1: J ≡ ~K (J if and only if not K)
- Premise 2: J ∨ L (J or L)
- Premise 3: ~K (not K)
- Conclusion: L

## 3: Construct a truth table for the premises and conclusion
To determine validity, we need to consider all possible truth values of J, K, and L.

## 4: Analyze Premise 1 (J ≡ ~K)
This is true when J and ~K have the same truth value (both true or both false).

## 5: Analyze Premise 2 (J ∨ L) and Premise 3 (~K)
Premise 2 is false only when both J and L are false. Premise 3 is true when K is false.

## 6: Determine the conditions for the argument to be valid
The argument is valid if there's no row in the truth table where all premises are true but the conclusion (L) is false.

## 7: Evaluate option C as a potential counterexample
Option C suggests a counterexample when J is true and K and L are false. Let's evaluate:
- If J is true, ~K must be true (from Premise 1), so K must be false.
- With K being false, ~K is true (Premise 3 is true).
- If L is false, then for Premise 2 (J ∨ L) to be true, J being true suffices.
- So, we have J=true, K=false, L=false. 
- Premise 1: J ≡ ~K is true because J=true and ~K=true.
- Premise 2: J ∨ L is true because J=true.
- Premise 3: ~K is true because K=false.
- Conclusion: L is false.

## 8: Conclusion on validity and counterexample
Given J=true, K=false, L=false:
- All premises are true (Premise 1: true, Premise 2: true because J is true, Premise 3: true).
- The conclusion (L) is false.

The best answer is C."
humanities,24,Rude,3,0,C,A,"## Step 1: Understand the argument structure
The argument given is:
1. J ≡ ~K
2. J ∨ L
3. ~K
∴ L

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
- J ≡ ~K means J is true if and only if K is false.
- J ∨ L means J or L (or both) are true.
- ~K means K is false.
The conclusion is L.

## 3: Construct a truth table for the premises and conclusion
To determine validity, we need a truth table with all possible combinations of J, K, and L.

| J | K | L | ~K | J ≡ ~K | J ∨ L |
|---|---|---|----|--------|-------|
| T | T | T | F  | F      | T     |
| T | T | F | F  | F      | T     |
| T | F | T | T  | T      | T     |
| T | F | F | T  | T      | T     |
| F | T | T | F  | F      | T     |
| F | T | F | F  | F      | F     |
| F | F | T | T  | F      | T     |
| F | F | F | T  | F      | F     |

## 4: Evaluate the argument's validity
The argument is valid if there's no row where all premises are true but the conclusion (L) is false.

## 5: Identify rows where all premises are true
From the premises:
- J ≡ ~K is true in rows 3 and 4.
- J ∨ L is true in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.
- ~K is true in rows 3, 4, 7, 8.

## 6: Find a counterexample
Looking for rows where J ≡ ~K, J ∨ L, and ~K are all true, and L is false.

## 7: Analyze specific rows for counterexample
- Row 4: J=T, K=F, L=F. Here, J ≡ ~K is T, J ∨ L is T, ~K is T, but L is F. This could be a counterexample.

## 8: Verify the counterexample
In row 4, J=T, K=F, L=F:
- J ≡ ~K is true because T ≡ T.
- J ∨ L is true because T ∨ F = T.
- ~K is true because ~F = T.
But L is F, which means we have a case where all premises are true, and the conclusion is false.

## 9: Match the counterexample to the given options
The counterexample in row 4 matches the condition when J is true and K and L are false.

The final answer is C."

8. J=F, K=F, L=F

## 5: Evaluate the premises and conclusion for each combination
We evaluate J ≡ ~K, J ∨ L, ~K, and L for each combination.

## 6: Determine the validity of the argument
The argument is invalid if there's at least one row where all premises are true but the conclusion is false.

## 7: Analyze specific rows for counterexamples
Given the nature of the question, let's directly assess critical rows:
- For J ≡ ~K and ~K to be true, J must be true (since ~K is true, K must be false, and J ≡ ~K implies J and ~K have the same truth value).
- If J is true, then J ∨ L is automatically true regardless of L.
- With ~K true (K false), and if J is true, we check if L can be false.

## 8: Evaluate a potential counterexample
If J=T, K=F, and L=F:
- J ≡ ~K is true because J=T and ~K=T.
- J ∨ L is true because J=T.
- ~K is true because K=F.
- But L is false.

## 9: Conclusion on validity
This specific scenario (J=T, K=F, L=F) makes all premises true but the conclusion false, indicating the argument is invalid.

## 10: Match to given options
This scenario matches option C: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false.

The final answer is: C"

humanities,123,Very Friendly,3,0,D,A,"## Step 1: Understand the argument structure
The given argument is: (G ≡ H) · ~I, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) / G. To assess its validity, we first need to understand what it's saying. The premises are (G ≡ H) · ~I and ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), and the conclusion is G.

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
- The first premise, (G ≡ H) · ~I, means that G is equivalent to H and I is false.
- The second premise, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), can be simplified using the associative property of disjunction to ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I.
- The conclusion is G.

## 3: Construct a truth table
To determine the validity of the argument, we need to construct a truth table for all possible combinations of G, H, and I.

## 4: Analyze possible truth values for G, H, and I
There are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations for the truth values of G, H, and I.

## 5: Evaluate the argument's validity
Without drawing the actual table due to format constraints, we evaluate:
- For the argument to be valid, there must be no row in the truth table where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.

## 6: Consider the options given for invalidity
- Option B suggests a counterexample when H and I are true and G is false.
- Option C suggests a counterexample when H is true and I and G are false.
- Option D suggests a counterexample when H, I, and G are false.

## 7: Assess option B
If H and I are true and G is false, then:
- (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent (G is false, H is true).
- ~I is false because I is true.
- So, (G ≡ H) · ~I is false.
- This makes the first premise false, which doesn't necessarily help in finding a counterexample since a counterexample requires both premises to be true and the conclusion false.

## 8: Assess option C
If H is true and I and G are false, then:
- (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent.
- ~I is true because I is false.
- So, (G ≡ H) · ~I is false.
- This scenario also doesn't serve as a counterexample for the same reason as option B.

## 9: Assess option D
If H, I, and G are false, then:
- (G ≡ H) is true because both G and H are false, making them equivalent.
- ~I is true because I is false.
- So, (G ≡ H) · ~I is true.
- ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) becomes true ∨ (true ∨ false) = true.
- The conclusion G is false.

## 10: Conclusion on validity
Given the assessment, the argument seems to have a counterexample.

The best answer is D."
humanities,123,Friendly,3,0,D,A,"## Step 1: Understand the argument structure
The argument given is: (G ≡ H) · ~I, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) / G. To assess its validity, we need to construct a truth table.

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
First premise: (G ≡ H) · ~I. This means G is equivalent to H and I is false.
Second premise: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I). This means either G is false or (H is false or I is true).
Conclusion: G.

## 3: Constructing the truth table
A full truth table for three variables (G, H, I) has 2^3 = 8 rows.

## 4: Evaluate the first premise (G ≡ H) · ~I
G ≡ H is true when G and H have the same truth value (both true or both false). ~I is true when I is false.

## 5: Evaluate the second premise ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)
This is true if G is false or if H is false or I is true.

## 6: Determine the conditions for the argument to be valid
The argument is valid if there's no row in the truth table where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.

## 7: Analyze potential counterexamples
Without drawing the actual table, we can consider the options given:
- For B (Invalid. Counterexample when H and I are true and G is false): If G is false, H is true, and I is true, then (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent, making the first premise false. The second premise ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) would be true because ~G is true. The conclusion G is false. This could potentially be a counterexample but let's check if it fits the premises.

## 8: Checking option B
If G is false, H is true, and I is true, then:
1. (G ≡ H) · ~I is false because ~I is false.
2. ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is true because ~G is true.
3. G is false.

## 9: Conclusion on validity
Given that we can find a scenario where the premises can be true and the conclusion false, or directly assessing the given choices, we determine validity.

The best answer is B."

The argument given is: (G ≡ H) · ~I, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) / G. To assess its validity, we need to construct a truth table.

## 2: Break down the premises and conclusion
Premise 1: (G ≡ H) · ~I
Premise 2: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)
Conclusion: G

## 3: Construct the truth table
Given that each of G, H, and I can be true (T) or false (F), there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

## 4: Evaluate Premise 1
(G ≡ H) is true if G and H have the same truth value (both T or both F). ~I is true if I is false.

## 5: Evaluate Premise 2
~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) is true if ~G is true or if ~H ∨ I is true.

## 6: Determine validity
Without drawing the actual table due to format constraints, we analyze:
- For the argument to be valid, whenever both premises are true, the conclusion must be true.
- A counterexample occurs when both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

## 7: Analyze potential counterexamples
Given the options:
- B: Invalid. Counterexample when H and I are true and G is false.
- C: Invalid. Counterexample when H is true and I and G are false.
- D: Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and G are false.

## 8: Assess option B
If H and I are true and G is false, then (G ≡ H) is false because G and H do not have the same truth value, making Premise 1 false. Thus, B may not serve as a counterexample since Premise 1 is false.

## 9: Assess option C
If H is true and I and G are false, then (G ≡ H) is false because G and H do not have the same truth value, and ~I is true. However, Premise 1 is false, so C may not be a valid counterexample.

## 10: Assess option D
If H, I, and G are false, then (G ≡ H) is true because G and H have the same truth value, and ~I is true, making Premise 1 true. For Premise 2: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) = T ∨ (T ∨ F) = T. The conclusion G is false.

## 11: Conclusion on validity
Given the assessment, we need to verify if there's a scenario where both premises are true, and G is false.

- The second premise, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I), can be simplified using the associative property of disjunction to ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I.
- The conclusion is G.

## 3: Construct a truth table
To construct a truth table, we need to consider all possible combinations of truth values for G, H, and I, which are 2^3 = 8 combinations.

## 4: Evaluate the first premise (G ≡ H) · ~I
- G ≡ H is true when both G and H have the same truth value (both true or both false).
- ~I is true when I is false.

## 5: Evaluate the second premise ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I
- This is true if any of ~G, ~H, or I are true.

## 6: Determine the validity of the argument
The argument is valid if there is no row in the truth table where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.

## 7: Analyze possible counterexamples
Without drawing the actual table due to format constraints, let's consider the options:
- For B (Invalid. Counterexample when H and I are true and G is false): If G is false, H is true, and I is true, then (G ≡ H) · ~I is false because ~I is false, making the first premise false. This doesn't serve as a counterexample since a counterexample requires both premises to be true and the conclusion false.
- For C (Invalid. Counterexample when H is true and I and G are false): If G and I are false and H is true, then (G ≡ H) is false because G and H are not equivalent, making the first premise false. This doesn't work as a counterexample.
- For D (Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and G are false): If G, H, and I are false, then (G ≡ H) is true because both are false, and ~I is true, making the first premise true. The second premise ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I is true because ~G and ~H are true. However, the conclusion G is false.

## 8: Conclusion based on analysis
Given the analysis, we can see that when G, H, and I are all false, the first premise (G ≡ H) · ~I is true because G ≡ H is true (both false) and ~I is true (I is false). The second premise ~G ∨ ~H ∨ I is also true because ~G and ~H are true. But the conclusion G is false. This matches option D.

The final answer is: D"

## 4: Analyze possible truth values for G, H, and I
There are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations for the truth values of G, H, and I.

## 5: Evaluate the argument for each combination
We will evaluate (G ≡ H) · ~I and ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) to see if they lead to G.

## 6: Determine validity or find a counterexample
If there's any row in the truth table where both premises are true but the conclusion (G) is false, the argument is invalid, and that row represents a counterexample.

## 7: Specific evaluation
Given the complexity of manually typing out the entire truth table here, let's consider critical rows:
- For G ≡ H to be true, G and H must have the same truth value.
- ~I means I must be false.

## 8: Consider a key scenario
If I is false, ~I is true. For (G ≡ H) · ~I to be true, G ≡ H must also be true. 

## 9: Evaluate with I = False
With I = False, ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) simplifies to ~G ∨ ~H because ~H ∨ False = ~H.

## 10: Look for counterexamples
A counterexample would be a scenario where (G ≡ H) · ~I and ~G ∨ ~H are true, but G is false.

## 11: Specific counterexample check
If G and H are both false (making G ≡ H true) and I is false, then:
- (G ≡ H) · ~I is true because G ≡ H is true and ~I is true.
- ~G ∨ ~H is true because both ~G and ~H are true.
- But G is false.

## 12: Conclusion on validity
This matches option D, where H, I, and G are false, making it a potential counterexample.
