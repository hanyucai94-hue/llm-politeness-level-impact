11,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? Bill, a single man, owned pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, which he leased to a tenant. He also owned a condominium in Miami, which he held for investment. In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated. Bill died the next day. How are the foregoing assets distributed?

A) Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.
B) Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.
C) Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.
D) Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.

33,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A landlord is the owner in fee simple of a tract of land on which is situated a large office building. The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions""(1) The tenant covenants to keep the building on the leased premises insured against fire in the amount of $100,000. ""After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to a doctor, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the doctor assigned his leasehold interest to a dentist. The dentist went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. Soon afterwards, a fire spread from an adjoining building to the leased property, completely destroying the building thereon. While the tenant was in possession of the leased property, he carried a fire insurance policy on the premises in the amount of $100,000. However, the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after his assignment to the doctor. The doctor did carry insurance on the leased building, but only in the amount of $50,000. When the dentist took possession of the building, he did not obtain any fire insurance. The landlord learned that the building was not insured at the time of the fire as per the original agreement. In an action by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the fire loss, the landlord will most probably

A) recover, because in accordance with the Rule in Spencer's Case, the covenant to maintain fire insurance would ""touch and concern"" the land.
B) recover, because the tenant's obligation to maintain fire insurance did not terminate after his assignment to the doctor.
C) not recover, because the covenant to provide fire insurance did not run with the land.
D) not recover, because the dentist, as assignee, would be liable for the fire loss.

66,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A man who owned a haberdashery placed an order by telephone from a wholesale supplier of cashmere and wool clothing, for ""triple-dozen purple cashmere socks, size 10 13 at current resale price. "" The supplier's sales agent orally accepted the order at the agreed price of $250 per dozen. In accordance with the supplier's customary business practice, the sales agent then mailed the following confirmation letter, which he signed and dated:""As per your telephone order, this letter serves to confirm the purchase of 36 dozen cashmere socks, color purple, size 10 13, at the agreed price of $250 per dozen. Total sales price: $9,000. ""This letter was received by the man, who briefly glanced at it but failed to notice the ""36 dozen"" wording or the total price. The man placed the letter in his files and did not respond to it. Three weeks later, the supplier tendered 36 dozen purple cashmere socks, which the man rejected on the grounds that he had ordered only three dozen. The supplier resold the same purple cashmere socks to another buyer for a total price of $8,000. The supplier sued the man for the $1,000 difference. If the man pleads the statute of frauds as a defense, will such a defense be successful?

A) Yes, because the statute was not satisfied by the supplier's tender of the goods, which were rejected by the man, and the supplier did not rely on the oral agreement other than by attempting delivery.
B) Yes, because the agreed price for three dozen socks was over $500, and the supplier's written memo incorrectly stated the quantity of goods ordered.
C) No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisf' the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.
D) No, because the supplier's written memo operated as an acceptance, with proposals for additional terms that became part of the contract after the man failed to object to such additional terms within a reasonable time.

This jurisdiction has the following bribery statute in effect:""Any person who offers or gives a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty of bribery. ""A real estate developer owned a large parcel of land in the suburbs. Although the developer wanted to build an office building on the property, the land was zoned residential. Due to the residential zoning, the developer could not pursue his planned development unless he received a variance from the building commission. The developer held a meeting with a member of the building commission to solicit his approval in securing a zoning variance. To do so, the developer gave the commission member $10,000 in exchange for his support in approving the zoning variance. Thereupon, the commission member voted to approve the variance, thus making it possible for the developer to commence construction of the office building. The developer was subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. During the course of the trial, the commission member testified that he faked the agreement with the developer and would have approved the zoning variance regardless of whether the developer gave him any money. Furthermore, in his defense, the developer presented evidence that the other six members of the building commission voted affirmatively to approve the variance. If the jury believed that the commission member would have approved the variance even had he not received the $10,000, the developer should be found

A) guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.
B) guilty, because he gave the commission member the $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.

""A real estate developer owned a large parcel of land in the suburbs. Although the developer wanted to build an office building on the property, the land was zoned residential. Due to the residential zoning, the developer could not pursue his planned development unless he received a variance from the building commission. The developer held a meeting with a member of the building commission to solicit his approval in securing a zoning variance. To do so, the developer gave the commission member $10,000 in exchange for his support in approving the zoning variance. Thereupon, the commission member voted to approve the variance, thus making it possible for the developer to commence construction of the office building. The developer was subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. During the course of the trial, the commission member testified that he faked the agreement with the developer and would have approved the zoning variance regardless of whether the developer gave him any money. Furthermore, in his defense, the developer presented evidence that the other six members of the building commission voted affirmatively to approve the variance. If the jury believed that the commission member would have approved the variance even had he not received the $10,000, the developer should be found

A) guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.
B) guilty, because he gave the commission member the $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.
C) not guilty, because the commission member did not receive a thing of value, since he would have approved the variance regardless of receiving any payment from the developer.
D) not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.

110,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A valid treaty between the United States and a foreign country provides for the elimination of all tariff barriers between the two countries. It authorizes the president of either country to issue a proclamation nullifying any state or local laws in that country that have the effect of impeding imports from the other country. The foreign country uses the metric system of measurement, and thus all goods produced there and exported to the United States are packaged in metric sizes, such as liters and kilograms. A law of a state in the United States requires all goods sold in that state to be packaged in traditional American sizes, such as quarts or pounds. Because the state law substantially impedes imports from the foreign country, the President of the United States has issued a proclamation nullifying the state law pursuant to the treaty. Is the President's proclamation valid?

A) No, because the Constitution vests in Congress the exclusive authority to specify binding legal standards for weights and measures, and the President therefore lacks constitutional authority for the proclamation.
B) No, because the principles of federalism embedded in the Constitution prohibit the President from taking action to invalidate a state law.
C) Yes, because it is authorized by a valid treaty of the United States and is not prohibited by any provision of the Constitution and, therefore, is the supreme law of the land.

In 1985, a landowner, the undisputed owner of an apartment building, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the landowner died leaving no heirs. In her will, the landowner left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment building was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the landowner died, the tenant, having learned of the landowner's death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts of America organization was unaware of the landowner's gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Girl Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the apartment building. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. In an ejection action by the Girl Scouts of America against the tenant, the organization will prevail

They then asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. The officers then explained that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant told the officers that he changed his mind and decided not to fly today after all. The officers still requested that the defendant turn his overnight bag over to them. The defendant did so, and then he was given permission to leave the airport. The next day, the police had a dog sniff the defendant's bag for narcotics. The results of this search gave police suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics. They opened the defendant's bag and found heroin inside. The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. At trial, the defendant's attorney moves to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence. This motion will most likely be

In that year, the conservationist conveyed the tract ""to my nephew in fee simple, provided, however, that the grantee agrees that neither he nor his heirs or assigns shall ever use the property for any commercial purpose. If any portion of said tract is used for other than residential purposes, then the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate. "" This deed was properly recorded. The nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, survived by his two daughters, his only heirs. During the period between 1981 and 2007, the spreading development from a nearby city began to engulf the tract. Though still undeveloped, the tract became surrounded by office buildings, shopping malls, and other commercial edifices. In 2009, the wife executed and delivered to a developer a fee simple conveyance of the tract, which the developer immediately recorded. The deed did not contain any reference to the restriction noted above.

He aimed his rifle at a small tree at the top of a nearby hill and fired three shots. At that moment, a state police officer happened to be passing nearby. The officer was part of a police team searching the forest for a fugitive who was believed to be armed and dangerous. When the police officer heard the gunshots, he thought he was being attacked. He quickly pulled his pistol out of his holster and fired it toward the brush from which he had seen the muzzle flash from the hunter's rifle. One of the bullets fired by the police officer struck the hunter and seriously wounded him.

The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin.

A guidance counselor remained on campus because he was working on a research project. After working late one night, the counselor decided to enter the room of a student from a very wealthy family. The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes.

240,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? The owner of a large family estate decided to sell the property. The owner entered into a valid written brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. According to terms of the agreement, the broker promised to undertake best efforts to sell the estate for a purchase price of not less than $1,250,000. The contract also provided that the broker was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The brokerage agreement was effective for a period of two months. One month later, the broker notified the owner that she had found a buyer who wanted to purchase the property for $1,500,000. That same day, the broker handed the owner a real estate sales contract, signed by the buyer, in which the buyer agreed to pay $1,500,000 for the purchase of the estate. The owner investigated the buyer and discovered he had sufficient funds to purchase the estate. However, the owner changed his mind and decided not to sell the property. He told the broker that he would not sign the agreement. In addition, the owner told the broker that he was canceling their brokerage agreement because he was withdrawing the estate from the market. The owner also refused to pay the broker any commission. If the broker now sues the owner for breach of contract, which of the following, if anything, is the broker's proper measure of recovery?

A) Nothing, because a condition precedent, namely the consummation of the sale and transfer of title, has failed to occur.
B) Quantum meruit for the reasonable value for services rendered in obtaining a buyer for the property.
C) $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since all conditions precedent to the owner's duty to pay the commission were fulfilled when the broker produced a buyer who was ready, willing and able to perform.
D) $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the consummation condition to the owner's duty to pay the commission was excused by the owner's refusal without cause to accept the buyer's offer and perform the land sale contract.

A witness in a murder case does not make the same statement faithfully, but rather he has given different versions of his observations at different times to different persons and investigators. The prosecution put the witness on the stand at trial to tell what he observed. The defendant's counsel impeached his testimony by bringing up prior inconsistent statements and accusing him of changing his story for trial. The prosecution then attempted to rehabilitate his credibility by referencing prior consistent statements. Prior consistent statements are not generally admissible because they are said to be repetitive, cumulative and to unfairly bolster the witness's credibility. Will the court likely allow the prosecution to rehabilitate the witness using prior consistent statements under these facts?

A) No, because the witness cannot be rehabilitated once a successful impeachment has occurred.
B) No, because it would tend to confuse the jury with too much conflicting evidence.
C) Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.

Upon receiving authority to make the arrest from their commanding officer, they waited for the two men to come out again. About two hours later, the two men came out again, this time with a woman. The officers arrested the two men and detained the woman to determine her involvement. The officers took the woman's purse without her consent and searched it for illegal narcotics. In her purse they found three grams of crack cocaine, digital scales, a small glass pipe used for inhaling crack cocaine, and a balloon of black tar heroin. The woman was then arrested on the various drug charges. The woman was thereafter prosecuted and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. She filed a motion to exclude the drugs and the paraphernalia from evidence. Her motion will most likely be

A) granted, because the police did not have probable cause to conduct the search of her purse.
B) granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before conducting the search.
C) denied, because the search was justified, since she was about to leave the scene of the crime.
D) denied, because she was sufficiently close or proximate to the crime scene to justifi the warrantless search.

When he became chronically ill and could not care for himself, his unmarried daughter moved into his home to take care of him. As time went on, the widower became senile, lost touch with reality, and required continuous care. When that happened, the caretaking daughter made out a deed to herself as grantee and had him sign as grantor. He was not aware of what he was doing when he signed it. After the widower died, the two married children sued to have the deed set aside for mental incompetence. Assuming they can prove the foregoing allegations, will the court likely strike down the deed?

A) No, because the caretaking daughter had a right to the property in return for all of the work that she performed.
B) No, because every deed is strongly presumed to be valid when signed.

Although he never lost consciousness, the pedestrian was in excruciating pain and has been taking strong painkillers since the accident that have affected his memory of the accident. At trial, the pedestrian calls a renowned hypnotist to testify. The hypnotist proposes to testify that after he placed the pedestrian under a hypnotic spell, the pedestrian gave a detailed account of the accident and told the hypnotist that the driver ran a red light and that the driver's license plate number was GIJO-7 14.

The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc. ). After the developer had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The developer used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The investor notified the developer that cracks were developing in the building situated on the investor's lot. The developer took the view that any subsidence suffered by the investor was due to the weight of the investor's building and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the investor's land been in its natural state. The developer continued to excavate. The building on the investor's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer?

A) The developer is liable, because she removed necessary support for the investor's lot.
B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.
C) Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.

A) Yes, because blocking a neighbor's sunlight is a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process.
B) Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.
C) No, because the trial court was correct in ruling that there had to be some violation of building regulations before the construction could be enjoined.
D) No, because a comparative evaluation of the benefits and detriments of each position favor the neighbor's position.

283,Professional Law,Very Rude,"You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this? An owner of a solar heated residence filed a lawsuit that tried to enjoin her neighbor from building a house that would totally interfere with her access to daily sunlight. The neighbor's plan conformed to all local building ordinances and land use regulations. The owner had been in the house for 10 years and the neighbor recently bought the adjoining lot. The owner showed that a different placement of the house would not interfere with her use and enjoyment of her residence.

287,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? Ann, Bea, and Carla were three friends who lived in the same neighborhood. While Ann was away on a business trip, someone broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement?

A) Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise.
B) Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it.
C) Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.
D) Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.

288,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question?

Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership ""standards,"" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights.

A) The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.

When husband lost his job, they had by that time paid for everything purchased on the account except for one chair they bought a few weeks earlier. The store sued, trying to repossess all furniture ever sold to the couple. Will the couple likely prevail on a defense of unconscionability?

A) No, because they might be able to find another store to sell them furniture, which proves that there was no lack of bargaining power.

A scientist used his car to transport a large quantity of highly flammable petroleum derivatives that he needed for his scientific research. The petroleum derivatives were sold in ordinary glass gallon jugs. Shortly after putting the jugs in the back of his car, the scientist was driving along a city street. He was thinking about a difficult scientific question and not paying attention to his driving. As a result, he lost control of the car and drove up onto the sidewalk. The car flipped over. The glass jugs in the back of the car were broken, and the chemicals in them spilled out onto the sidewalk. Moments later, a doctor who witnessed the accident came running over to render medical assistance. As he approached the overturned car, however, the doctor slipped on the petroleum derivatives that had spilled onto the sidewalk. The doctor fell and fractured his ankle. If the doctor asserts a claim against the scientist based on strict liability, will the doctor prevail?

A) Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.
B) Yes, because the transportation of flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs necessarily involves a high degree of risk of serious harm.
C) No, because the doctor assumed the risk by voluntarily acting as a Good Samaritan.
D) No, because it was unforeseeable that the doctor's injury would result from the type of harm threatened.

The petroleum derivatives were sold in ordinary glass gallon jugs. Shortly after putting the jugs in the back of his car, the scientist was driving along a city street. He was thinking about a difficult scientific question and not paying attention to his driving. As a result, he lost control of the car and drove up onto the sidewalk. The car flipped over. The glass jugs in the back of the car were broken, and the chemicals in them spilled out onto the sidewalk. Moments later, a doctor who witnessed the accident came running over to render medical assistance. As he approached the overturned car, however, the doctor slipped on the petroleum derivatives that had spilled onto the sidewalk. The doctor fell and fractured his ankle. If the doctor asserts a claim against the scientist based on strict liability, will the doctor prevail?

A) Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.
B) Yes, because the transportation of flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs necessarily involves a high degree of risk of serious harm.
C) No, because the doctor assumed the risk by voluntarily acting as a Good Samaritan.
D) No, because it was unforeseeable that the doctor's injury would result from the type of harm threatened.

313,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? After months of negotiations, the United States and Canada entered into a tax treaty that provided that neither country would impose income taxes on citizens of the other nation. The treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, was supported by professional baseball and hockey players. Many Canadian hockey players, who were employed by American teams and lived in the United States during the hockey season, lobbied for passage of the treaty, since they were subject to the payment of both U. S. and Canadian income taxes. In like manner, many American baseball players, who lived in Canada during the baseball season, objected to the same dual taxation. In violation of the treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U. S. citizen who resided in Canada, of illegally evading the payment of Canadian income taxes. The U. S. citizen, who was a member of a Canadian baseball team, resided in Canada during the baseball season. Following his conviction, the President announced that the previously effective tax treaty would no longer be abided by the United States. The President proclaimed that Canada's refusal to honor the treaty rendered it invalid. As a result, the President ordered the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income taxes from Canadian citizens residing in the United States in the same manner that it collects taxes from other residents of this country. A Canadian citizen and resident of the United States, sues in an appropriate federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the treaty with Canada remains valid and effective. Therefore, he contends that the Internal Revenue Service may not collect U. S. income taxes from him. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional basis that may be urged in support of this claim?

A) The President's unilateral termination of a treaty benefiting residents of the United States cannot be effective until a hearing is afforded to persons who would be affected by such action.
B) The courts have exclusive authority to determine whether a particular treaty has, in fact, been breached by another nation.
C) A ratified treaty is the supreme law of the land and, therefore, remains effective until superseded by another treaty or statute.
D) The treaty created a property right in Canadian citizens residing in the United States that cannot be taken away without just compensation.

City public officials, however, refused to grant the man the necessary food vendor's license despite the fact that he could prove that his restaurant complied with all provisions of the municipal licensing ordinance. Section 1287 of the city food vending ordinance provides, in part, that ""a food vendor's license shall be issued to any applicant who properly complies with all of the health requirements of this ordinance.

A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:""No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. ""Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. ""At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later. If the resident alien brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States, the court will most likely declare the statute

A) constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.
B) constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.

This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty.

The only information provided was a general notice from the city declaring a new policy on massage parlors that had to be rapidly instituted for the welfare of the community. She sued the city in federal court, claiming that her business had been taken without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment takings clause. She claimed a lack of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court granted a motion to dismiss based on her not having a property interest that was affected, including in the license and permits. She appealed the decision. Will the federal Court of Appeals affirm the lower court dismissal of her case?

A) Yes, because there is no right to earning a living under the substantive due process clause.
B) Yes, because the state interest in protecting the public from illegal activities required the state action that was taken.
C) No, because once the parlor had opened with all the proper permits, it could not be deprived of its licenses for any reason until they were up for renewal.
D) No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.

367,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? The state charged the accused with the intentional murder of a former girlfriend. He admitted to killing her, but asserted that he lacked the intent to murder, due to his suffering from a personality disorder complicated by two days of drinking alcohol heavily. The trial judge instructed the jury that ""the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts."" The judge did not tell them that they had a choice or could infer another conclusion; they were told only that the law presumed it. The accused was convicted of depraved heart murder and sentenced to 100 years in prison. On appeal, the appellant argued that the court took the fact-finding task of determining criminal intent out of the jury's hands by in effect ordering them to find intent. The jury could have felt that they were being told that they had no other choice. The state supreme court affirmed the conviction, but the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely reverse the conviction?

A) Yes, because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder.
B) Yes, because the wording in effect caused the defendant to be a witness against himself by having him intend everything that he did.
C) No, because the defendant could raise an argument to rebut the permissible inference created by the jury instruction.
D) No, because the instruction was only a presumption that the jury did not have to consider in its deliberations.

She parked in the store's parking lot, and while walking toward the building two masked males assaulted and raped her. The lot was poorly lit, had no security personnel, and was frequented by gang members. The police had several incident reports in the past 12 months documenting prior criminal activities, including some personal robberies and assaults, in the lot. The store itself had even more reports than the police. The woman sued the store for her injuries, claiming that it breached its duty to make the premises reasonably safe for its customers. Will she likely prevail?

A) Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers.
B) No, the store owes no special duty of care to eliminate crime on the parking lot; it was up to the police to perform that task.
C) No, the occurrence of a rape of a customer was not a foreseeable event and the store had no duty to try and discover that such a potential danger could exist.
D) Yes, a store owner is the guarantor to every customer that he or she will be protected and safe when walking in the parking lot.

After doing a thorough inspection of the car, the mechanic told the woman that her car needed extensive work and that he could do all that was needed for $1,000. The parties then entered into a written contract to have the car serviced for $1,000. As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. While servicing the car, the mechanic discovered that a belt was severel' worn and need to be replaced. The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so. When the mechanic was finished, he presented the woman with a bill for $1,100, representing the $1,000 called for by the contract and $100 for the replacement of the worn belt, which is a reasonable amount. The woman refused to pay any more than$1,000. The mechanic sued the woman to collect the $100 for the replacement of the worn belt.

375,Professional Law,Neutral,"A woman took her car to a mechanic to be serviced. After doing a thorough inspection of the car, the mechanic told the woman that her car needed extensive work and that he could do all that was needed for $1,000. The parties then entered into a written contract to have the car serviced for $1,000. As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. While servicing the car, the mechanic discovered that a belt was severel' worn and need to be replaced. The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so. When the mechanic was finished, he presented the woman with a bill for $1,100, representing the $1,000 called for by the contract and $100 for the replacement of the worn belt, which is a reasonable amount. The woman refused to pay any more than$1,000. The mechanic sued the woman to collect the $100 for the replacement of the worn belt.

378,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? Within the last two years, the number of cases coming before the U. S. Supreme Court has quadrupled. Because of this increased work load, the Court has complained that it is unable to properly review all of its cases. As a consequence, Congress formed a committee to conduct a study on improving the functioning and operation of the Court. Based on the committee's recommendations, Congress enacted a statute dividing the Court into two panels. One panel would be assigned to handle criminal cases exclusively, while the other panel would handle all non-criminal matters. Each panel would be composed of four associate justices and a chief justice. According to the new law, the decisions of each panel would be final and not reviewable by any other court or judiciary. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute?

A) The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.
B) The statute does not fall within the enumerated powers of Congress and is not necessary and proper for the effectuation of those powers.
C) Based on the doctrine ofjudicial supremacy, Congress does not have authority to legislate with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

381,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A seller signed an agreement to sell a residential parcel to a prospective purchaser. The agreement required her to convey good and marketable title. The title search revealed an open mortgage from a previous owner to a local bank. It was recorded 25 years ago. The mortgagor could not be found and the bank lost its records. The purchase agreement gave the seller 90 days extra in such a situation to clear title by bringing a quiet title action. The seller did not follow that provision and went to settlement with the bad title and demanded more extra time to file a quiet title action. The buyer decided not to wait and demanded her down payment be returned and that the deal be rescinded. Will litigation most likely favor the buyer's position?

A) Yes, because the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.
B) No, because the seller always has the right to bring an action for adverse possession against the holder of the open mortgage.
C) Yes, because the open mortgage is so old that it would be declared void by all courts.
D) No, because the buyer did not act in good faith when it refused to give the seller additional time at the closing.

A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy. The court should

A) grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.
B) grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.

384,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? An avid baseball fan learned that a local professional baseball club was conducting a baseball camp for fans who wanted to meet and receive instruction from the club's players. The cost of the two-week camp was advertised for $2,500, which included meals and housing. The fan, a 54-year-old salesman, forwarded the club a $50 registration deposit, which reserved him a spot in the baseball camp. Thereafter, the fan received a contract from the club, which all baseball camp attendees were required to sign. The agreement provided that the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable. According to the agreement, all attendees would receive group instruction during the baseball camp. Consequently, the club's operating costs would not be reduced if one or more of the attendees failed to participate or complete the two-week program. The fan signed the contract and forwarded it with his $2,500 entrance fee to the club. Two days before the start of the baseball camp, however, the fan died from a heart attack. In a restitutionary action, can the executor of the fan's estate, a surviving brother, recover on behalf of the estate either all or part of the $2,500 paid to the club?

A) No, but only if the club can show that before the start of the baseball camp it rejected another applicant because of its commitment to the fan.
B) No, because under the terms of the agreement the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable.
C) Yes, because the club would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the fan's expense.
D) Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

An avid baseball fan learned that a local professional baseball club was conducting a baseball camp for fans who wanted to meet and receive instruction from the club's players. The cost of the two-week camp was advertised for $2,500, which included meals and housing. The fan, a 54-year-old salesman, forwarded the club a $50 registration deposit, which reserved him a spot in the baseball camp. Thereafter, the fan received a contract from the club, which all baseball camp attendees were required to sign. The agreement provided that the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable. According to the agreement, all attendees would receive group instruction during the baseball camp. Consequently, the club's operating costs would not be reduced if one or more of the attendees failed to participate or complete the two-week program.

A contractor learned that a city intended to open a new grammar school and was going to ask for bids to construct the school. The contractor decided to submit a bid to do the construction. The contractor contacted all of the subcontractors she had worked with in the past, informed them of the specifics of the school construction project, and asked each to submit a bid for the work they would be requested to perform. An insulation company submitted a bid of $25,000 to do the required insulation work in the new school. Based on that and other subcontract bids, the contractor prepared a general bid and submitted it to the city. Three days after the contractor submitted the bid to the city, the insulation company notified the contractor that it had overbooked its workforce and would be unable to perform the insulation work. The next day, the city notified the contractor that she had won the bid to build the school. The contractor was forced to find another company to do the insulation work. The other company charged the contractor $30,000 to do the insulation. Which of the following arguments best supports the claim for $5,000 by the contractor against the insulation company?

A) The contractor had made an offer to the insulation company that the latter accepted when it submitted its bid.
B) The insulation company had made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city.
C) The insulation company's bid was an offer that it was obligated to hold open, because the insulation company and the contractor were merchants.

There was a high wind blowing in the direction of the land that the landlord leased to the tenant, and the wind carried the burning leaves onto the tenant's property. The building caught fire and caused $150,000 in fire damages. Because of the fire, the tenant has not occupied the leased premises since the date of the fire because the building was rendered uninhabitable. This state is a common law jurisdiction. In addition, the controlling Statute of Limitations for initiating an action for damages due to negligence is five years from the time the cause of damage occurs. On May 1, 2004, the landlord brings suit against the tenant asserting breach of contract for failing to pay the rent. Judgment should be for

A) the landlord, because a tenant remains liable to pay rent, even though as a result of the fire, the property was rendered uninhabitable.
B) the landlord, because the covenant to pay rent runs with the land.
C) the tenant, because it would be inequitable to enforce the rental provision in the lease because the premises was rendered uninhabitable.

A state on the eastern seaboard has a long stretch of scenic, ecologically unique, and relatively unspoiled seacoast. Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission. When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area. He did so without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the man to establish title to the walkway area, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?

A) Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.
B) Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.
C) Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.
D) Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.

When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area. He did so without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the man to establish title to the walkway area, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?

A) Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.
B) Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.
C) Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.
D) Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.

The woman devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate her husband's guacamole with a poisonous substance called strychnine. To facilitate her plan, she enlisted the help of her boyfriend. At first, the boyfriend adamantly refused to go along with her scheme, but when the woman threatened to break off their relationship, he reluctantly agreed. The boyfriend, a pre-med student, got the strychnine from the pharmacy by telling them that he was using it for an experiment with rats. The boyfriend then gave the strychnine to the woman, who sprinkled it in her husband's guacamole. The husband died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: ""Any intentional and premeditated killing or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness.

429,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A repairman repaired damaged electrical power lines and replaced old, worn-out equipment whenever necessary for the local municipal electrical company. After a violent tornado had ripped through the city, the electrical company was busily trying to restore electrical power to its customers. The morning after the storm, the repairman was perched on a ladder trying to repair a high-voltage power line. As he was removing the cover of the transformer box, the ladder suddenly slipped on the wet ground, even though it had been properly fixed into position. The repairman struggled to maintain his balance and, luckily, the ladder came to rest against the transformer box. A pedestrian, who was walking on the street below, saw the repairman's predicament and began to climb the ladder to aid him. As the pedestrian was ascending the ladder, his foot slipped, and he fell to the ground. His fall caused the ladder to jar loose the transformer box, which in turn sent the repairman falling to the pavement. The repairman and the pedestrian both suffered serious injuries. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the electrical company for his injuries, he will most likely

A) prevail, because he was attempting to rescue the repairman.
B) prevail, because a public utility company is strictly liable in tort.
C) not prevail, because he was negligent in climbing the ladder.
D) not prevail, because the repairman was not negligent in not affixing the ladder properly.

After the defendant learned about these rumors, she was furious and decided that she would teach the woman to keep her mouth shut. Late that night, the defendant went over to the woman's house with the intent to punch her in the mouth. When the defendant arrived at the woman's home, she peered in the bedroom window and saw the woman asleep in bed. The defendant proceeded to pry open the bedroom window and climbed inside. The defendant then grabbed the woman and punched her in the face and hurriedly fled from the home. The force of the blow fractured the woman's jaw. If the defendant is subsequently prosecuted for burglary, she will most likely be found

A) guilty, because she broke into the woman's home at night with the intent to commit a felony therein.
B) guilty, because the woman suffered a broken jaw as a result of the blow inflicted by the defendant.
C) not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to seriously injure the woman.
D) not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to commit a felony at the time of the breaking and entry.

During shopping hours, a group of 10 protesters gathered in the pedestrian area near the entrance to a department store to denounce the sale of animal fur products in that store. The protesters were peaceful and did not interfere with traffic into or out of the store, but they carried signs and vocally communicated their message to people walking in the area. Mall management quickly broke up the protest and required the protesters to leave the mall. The protesters have sued the mall, claiming that their right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was violated. Should the protesters prevail?

A) No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.
B) No, because the prohibition of protests adjacent to the entrance of a department store during shopping hours is a constitutionally proper limitation on the time, place, and manner of speech.
C) Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.
D) Yes, because the mall's restriction on the protesters' speech was broader than necessary to ensure proper access to the department store.

454,Professional Law,Neutral,"A woman owned land that abutted a public highway to the south. A neighbor owned the land immediately to the north. The neighbor's predecessor had received an easement from the woman's predecessor in title to cross the woman's land for access to the public highway. This access was desired even though the neighbor and his predecessor had other access to public roads. Recently, the woman erected a large solar collector on a portion of her land subject to the easement, even though the woman has other power resources. The location was essential to acquire the maximum sunlight. However, by erecting the collector there, the woman effectively cut off the neighbor's ability to use the easement. The local zoning code permits the use of solar collectors. The neighbor immediately sued to compel the woman to remove the solar collector. Must the solar collector be removed?

A) No, because the neighbor has other means of access.

462,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A law school professor was hired to teach a bar review course. The professor taught the course in three cities. After conducting the sessions, the professor submitted an expense report to the owner of the bar review course. Her expense voucher included a $225 travel expenditure to a fourth city where the professor had attended a symposium unrelated to the bar review course. The professor also submitted the $225 travel expenditure to the administrator for the faculty at the law school where she teaches. The dean of the law school had previously approved the professor's appearance at the symposium. The owner paid the professor for the symposium-related expenditure but indicated that the expense item was improperly billed to his company. The professor was indicted for false pretenses.

480,Professional Law,Very Rude,"You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this? A recent law school graduate was hired by a bar review course, under an oral agreement, as an editorial consultant. Her job responsibilities included preparing new course outlines, proofreading and grading student homework assignments. The bar review course agreed to pay the graduate a starting salary of $2,500 a month. Three months later, the graduate was approached by the regional director of the bar review course, who handed her a newly published 60-page booklet entitled ""Employment Manual. "" He instructed the graduate to read the manual and indicated that it contained important information concerning company policy considerations and employee benefits. When the graduate returned home that evening, she started to read the manual. After reading about 30 pages, the graduate became tired and went to sleep. She never got around to reading the rest of the manual. Six months later, the graduate received a termination notice from the bar review course. The notice indicated that the graduate was being fired for insubordination because she had complained about the poor quality of the bar review course's materials and refused to work overtime grading papers. Following her dismissal, the graduate brought suit against the bar review course for breach of contract. Which of the following, if true and provable, would furnish the bar review course with its best defense?

A) All other bar review course employees worked overtime whenever requested to do so.
B) When the graduate accepted employment with the bar review course, the company never made any promises regarding job security or duration of employment.

She said, ""Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work."" She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?

A) The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.
B) The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.
C) The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.
D) There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.

A few weeks later, the farmer was using the truck to haul a load of supplies to his farm. As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?

A) No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.
B) No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.
C) Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.

Violation of the statute is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $500 or more than $5,000 The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. The defendant, a recovering alcoholic, worked as a cashier at a drug store. Late one night while the defendant was working alone, he got the urge to have a drink. He opened a bottle of rum that the store sold and soon began drinking. A short time later, the defendant became inebriated and passed out. Not long thereafter, a 15-year-old girl entered the store to purchase a package of cigarettes. She took a box off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for them. Seeing the defendant lying on the floor, unconscious, the girl left the exact price for the cigarettes on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, he should be found

A) guilty, because the offense does not require any mental state.
B) guilty, because the defendant's intoxication was voluntaiy.

A) The driver was acting erratically by blasting music in the middle of an auto accident investigation, and when a gun was spotted this justified a custodial interrogation and a search of the car.
B) The officer had a right to separate the driver from the gun, and the ensuing procedures and search were reasonably calculated to protect the officers and the other motorists.
C) The officer in effect overreacted to the initial purpose of the stop, and initiated an arrest procedure without probable cause to do so, and thus the drugs will be suppressed.
D) The drugs will be suppressed because the officer had no right to order the driver out of the car simply because a legal weapon was observed on the seat.

A) A defendant wanted to receive the proceeds from her insurance policy on her home. After a careful examination of her policy, she decided that the best way for her to collect would be to stage a cooking accident in her own home and have the structure bum down. She decided that bacon would be the best way to do it because all of the extra grease in the pan could easily catch on fire. After cooking the bacon, the defendant left the flame on and left her home. Unbeknownst to the defendant, she left the window open and a breeze blew out the pilot. When the defendant returned home, she found that there was no fire. She was arrested and charged with attempted arson.
B) A defendant was dancing with his girlfriend at a local club when she collapsed in his arms. The defendant then carried his girlfriend to his car and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Although the defendant believed that his girlfriend was intoxicated, she had, in fact, died of a heart attack while dancing. The defendant is charged with attempted rape.
C) After a preliminary examination, a defendant informed a patient that she was two months pregnant. Although the defendant knew that abortions were illegal in this jurisdiction, he agreed to perform an abortion on the patient, anyway. During the operation, it was discovered that the patient was not pregnant. The defendant is charged with attempt to perform an illegal abortion.
D) A defendant called his friend to obtain some marijuana. The friend told the defendant that he had some for sale. Believing that his friend had some high-quality marijuana, the defendant purchased an ounce of the substance, which he did not know was actually oregano. While the defendant was smoking the oregano on the street corner, a police officer arrested him and charged him with attempted illegal use of a controlled substance.

561,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A man who was reportedly a renowned art thief was on trial for stealing several Picassos from a museum. The paintings had been recovered and were in the courtroom. The prosecution presented a professor of art history to authenticate each piece. The defense objected on the basis that the museum curator where the paintings were housed had to identify if these were in fact the paintings that were stolen. Assuming that others will testify to the fact of the burglary, is the court likely to reject this witness as being qualified to authenticate the paintings in question, and why or why not?

A) Yes, because art works and other physical evidence must be authenticated by their official custodian.

567,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A train pulled into a busy station. Some passengers got off the train, and others got on. A few moments later, a train conductor shouted, ""All aboard!"" to indicate that the train was about to depart the station. At that moment, a man, carrying a large cardboard box, came running through the station toward the train ""Wait for me!"" he shouted as he ran toward the train. The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, ""You can make it,"" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train. The rocket's collision caused a shelf on the wall to fall. A large container of coffee that was on the shelf fell and hit a customer who was sitting in the shop and enjoying a cup of coffee. The coffee shop customer suffered an injury to her shoulder as a result of being hit by the container of coffee. If the coffee shop customer asserts a negligence claim against the railroad, which of the following elements of her claim will the plaintiff be unable to satisfy?

A) Duty.
B) Breach.

A young woman joined a social media service that provided networking with other business persons and entities nationwide. The woman discovered that the service was selling her personal profile information, and the information pertaining to thousands of other members, to third party purchasers for tracking of their Internet activities and buying habits. In her class action breach of contract action against the service, she alleged two theories of damages. First, she contended that she and the class members suffered ""embarrassment and humiliation"" from the disclosure, and second, that she and the others must be compensated for the market value of the information seized. Will the court likely recognize these allegations as sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract?

A) Yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.
B) Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.
C) No, because Internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads of this nature as part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights.
D) No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.

576,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A mechanic agreed in writing to make repairs to a landscaper's truck for $12,000. The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?

A) No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.
B) No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.
C) Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.

603,Professional Law,Neutral,"While relaxing at poolside one Sunday afternoon, a homeowner was struck by a golf ball driven by a 14-year-old boy who was playing the ninth hole at the local golf course. The fairway for the ninth hole was 65 feet wide and 437 yards long, with a dogleg in an easterly direction. Between the fairway and the homeowner's property was a ""rough,"" containing brush and low-lying trees. The boy had hit a towering shot down the middle of the fairway that deflected off a tree and struck the homeowner in the head. The homeowner brought suit against the boy for his injuries suffered when he was hit by the golf ball. At trial, the boy offered uncontested evidence that golf balls from the golf course regularly traversed onto the homeowner's property two to three times a day. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the boy's liability for trespass?

608,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A teenage girl was babysitting a two-year-old baby. She took the baby in a stroller to the public park, as she often did. On this day, she negligently ""nodded off"" for just a few seconds on a park bench with the stroller next to her. She felt some movement and snapped awake to see a man taking the baby from the stroller. The man was large and menacing-looking. The babysitter, who is thin and petite, froze and did not put up a struggle as the man stated, ""I will kill you if you move."" The babysitter did scream and call for help as the kidnapper fled with the child. Within a few yards he tripped and dropped the baby on its head. The baby died at the hospital of massive head injuries. Is it probable that the prosecutor will charge the babysitter with a crime, and if so, what will be the charge?

A) Yes, this is felony murder in that the babysitter's unacceptable behavior was committed during the commission of the kidnapping felony.
B) No, the babysitter did not commit a criminal act under the circumstances  her negligence was not gross enough to rise to the level of criminality and she had no criminal intent.
C) No, because she did not do anything wrong in dozing off and she had no duty to protect the baby at the expense of her own life.
D) Yes, she would be charged with negligent homicide because it was foreseeable that if she fell asleep for even just a few seconds, the baby would likely be kidnapped and killed.

618,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A man owned a four-story apartment building. The man borrowed $125,000 from his friend to make improvements. As consideration for the loan, the man executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the apartment building. The mortgage was dated January 1, 2008, and was recorded January 2, 2008. Thereafter, on February 1, 2008, the man executed a deed absolute on the apartment building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the man then delivered the deed to an escrow agent in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the man failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1, 2009, the man failed to pay the note when it came due. The next day, the escrow agent delivered the deed to the apartment building to the friend. The friend then properly recorded this deed on January 3. One week later, on January 10, the friend conveyed the apartment building by warranty deed to an investor for the purchase price of $200,000. On January 12, the man tendered the $125,000 balance due to the friend, which he refused to accept. The man now brings an appropriate action against the friend and the investor to set aside the conveyance and to permit the redemption of the property by the man. Which of the following best states the man's legal rights, if any, in his action against the friend and the investor?

A) The man has no rights against the investor, but the man does have an action for redemption against the friend for the value of the property.
B) The man has no rights against the friend, but the man does have an action for redemption against the investor for the value of the property.
C) The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but the man cannot set aside the conveyance.
D) The man has no rights against either the friend or the investor because he defaulted on the promissory note.

"" The second friend, who had consumed a fifth of bourbon, was very intoxicated. Thinking that the gun was unloaded, the second friend responded, ""Sure, dude. "" The first friend then pulled the trigger. The gun just made a clicking sound as the hammer fell on an empty chamber of the cylinder. The two friends both laughed and continued partying. Unbeknownst to the second friend, the first friend had placed bullets in two of the revolver's six firing chambers before making his challenge. The next day, the second friend found out that the gun was, in fact, loaded when the first friend pulled the trigger. If the second friend asserts a tort action against the first friend, he will most likely

A) prevail, because the first friend intended to place the second friend in apprehension.
B) prevail, because there was a substantial certainty that the second friend would be placed in apprehension.
C) not prevail, because the second friend was unaware that the gun was loaded.
D) not prevail, because the second friend consented to participate in the Russian roulette game.

622,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? Late one evening, a police department received a telephone call from an unidentified woman who reported hearing loud shrieks and screams from a neighboring home. The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder. Thus, two detectives went to question the husband about the killing. When they arrived at his apartment, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them into his apartment. Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison. The husband is subsequently subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Before his scheduled appearance, the husband files a motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison, contending that the evidence was illegally obtained. His motion should be

A) granted, because the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional.
B) granted, because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.
C) denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.
D) denied, because the landlord had the apparent authority to authorize the search of the husband's apartment.

627,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? An avid baseball fan wanted to purchase tickets for an upcoming baseball game being held at the local stadium. He contacted the stadium's ticket sales office, which advised him that all tickets were to be placed on sale at the stadium at 9:00 a. m. the following day. The fan, who was employed as a bricklayer, realized that he could not leave work to purchase the tickets. Consequently, the fan telephoned his next-door neighbor and asked him if he would be interested in going to the stadium to purchase the baseball tickets. The neighbor told the fan that he would be happy to purchase the tickets for him and that he (the neighbor) also wanted to buy tickets for himself. However, the neighbor said that his car had broken down and that he did not have available transportation to get to the stadium. The fan suggested that he could lend his car to the neighbor. The neighbor agreed, and the following morning the two men met in front of the fan's home. The fan gave the neighbor the keys to his car and also money with which to buy his baseball tickets. Thereafter, the neighbor drove the fan's car to the stadium where he purchased the tickets for the fan and (using his own money) also bought a set of tickets for himself. The fan had instructed the neighbor to return the car to the fan's home after his trip to the stadium. After the neighbor left the stadium, however, he decided to visit a friend in a town located 120 miles from his home. As the neighbor was driving toward the town, an automobile crashed into him, causing significant damage to the fan's car. The cost of repairing the fan's car was determined to be more than the retail value of the auto. In an action by the fan against the neighbor to recover damages resulting from the accident, the fan will most likely

In an effort to improve the health care of AIDS patients in the state, the Legislature has enacted a law providing public funds to assist privately owned hospitals. According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each AIDS patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy ""would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. ""Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of the state's statute?

A) The statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, by adopting the controversial views of particular churches on abortion.
B) The statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment by conditioning the availability of public funds upon the recipient's agreement to act in a way that makes more difficult the exercise by others of their fundamental constitutional rights.
C) The statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying nonAIDS patients the same subsidy benefits as those received by AIDS patients.
D) The state will be unable to show it is advancing a legitimate governmental interest.

Two weeks later, the buyer was driving to work when the brakes suddenly failed. The buyer tried to stop the van for a red light, but the brakes failed to operate. As a consequence, the buyer drove through the red light and collided with a car driven by a woman. Subsequently, the woman asserted a claim against the buyer to recover for the injuries she suffered in the accident. At trial, the only evidence offered by the plaintiff concerning the cause of the accident was the testimony of an engineering expert.

Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, the boy filled a bucket with ice-cold water and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, thinking that his father would take the guests' coats there to put them on the bed. The boy then went off to play at a friend's house. The boy's father decided to keep all the guests' coats in the hall closet instead of putting them in the guest bedroom. Later that evening, one of the guests mistakenly wandered into the guest bedroom while searching for a bathroom. As the guest opened the door, the bucket fell and hit his head, causing a severe cut that required a dozen stitches. If the guest sues the boy for negligence, the most likely result is

A) the boy wins, because a child's conduct cannot be negligent.
B) the boy wins, because the guest unreasonably assumed the risk of entering an unfamiliar room rather than asking for directions to the bathroom.
C) the boy loses, because this ""practical joke"" posed a risk of severe harm and, therefore, the boy had a duty to exercise as much care as a reasonable adult.

652,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? In 1940, a state conveyed to a man a tract of land by deed that was immediately recorded. The man died a widower in 1990, devising all of his real property to his son. The will was duly probated shortly thereafter. In 2005, the son conveyed the tract of land to a friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 2009. The son's will, duly probated following his death, named the friend as sole legatee and devisee of the son's entire estate. In 2008, the son mortgaged the tract of land to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 2008, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to a rancher in 1988 and recorded in 1988. In that instrument, the son purported to grant the rancher a mortgage on the tract of land. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, the State of Baden has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. What is the probable legal effect of the son's mortgage agreement in 2008 with the bank?

A) The mortgage would be invalid, because the son conveyed his interest in the property to the friend in 2005.
B) The mortgage would be invalid, because the first mortgage in 1988 would take precedence over the second mortgage.
C) The mortgage would be invalid, unless the mortgagee bank had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the friend.

655,Professional Law,Very Rude,"You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this? Congress enacted a statute aimed at ""countries assisting or furnishing aid or support to nations or movements engaged in hostilities with the United States. "" Section 5 of that act authorized and directed the Treasury Department ""to issue orders barring entry into the United States any category of goods the sale of which in the United States is likely to improve the economic or balance of payments posture of an assisting country. "" The Secretary of State was authorized by Section 6 to define ""assisting countries. "" Pursuant to Section 5, the Treasury Department issued a regulation, which provided in part that:""Imports of the following categories of goods from assisting countries are hereby prohibited: ¢ . (c) Bulk shipments for resale within the United States of books, pamphlets, flags, decorations or other symbols, excepting, however, scientific, technical, and literary works intended for scholarly purpose. . . ""The State Department designated a foreign country, as an ""assisting country,"" on the basis of its determination that medical supplies collected by public donation in this country had been sent to another country currently engaged in hostilities with the United States. As a consequence, the Treasury Department issued an order barring practically all products and goods from this foreign country into the United States. A distributor of state and foreign flags, has had a lucrative contract with the foreign country for the importation and sale of their flags in the United States. However, because of the Treasury Department's order, the foreign country is now barred from importing any of its flags into the United States. In an appropriate federal court, the distributor brings a suit against the Secretary of State and the Treasury Department to set aside the order barring the foreign country's imports on the grounds that it is inconsistent with the principles of our constitutional form of government. Which of the following is the most proper disposition of the distributor's suit by the federal court?

A) Suit dismissed, because the distributor does not have standing to bring this action.
B) Suit dismissed, because there is no adversity between the distributor and the defendants.
C) Suit dismissed, because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.
D) Suit dismissed, because it presents a moot issue.

669,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A man was under custodial interrogation as a suspect in the murder of a child. The police initially gave him a written list of his Miranda rights. They told him to read the list out loud, which he did. They then asked him if he understood the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present and he nodded affirmatively. He refused to sign the writing but did not ask for an attorney. During the next three hours they interrogated him and got few answers; he was largely silent but did respond at times with a ""no"" or ""yes"" or a nod of the head. Then one of the detectives asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. His eyes welled with tears and he said ""yes."" This opened further questioning leading to his admission of guilt. He would not sign a written confession or a waiver of the right to remain silent. He was arrested for murder and moved to suppress the confession. Will the court suppress the confession as being involuntarily given?

A) No, the circumstances indicate that he understood that he could stop the questioning and get a lawyer but he did not do so.
B) No, whenever a written list of Miranda warnings is given to a suspect and he doesn't ask for a lawyer, this is proof that the suspect fully understands his rights.
C) Yes, the confession must be suppressed because he was questioned for over three hours, making anything he said essentially involuntary.
D) Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orderedthat the premises, now owned by an appliance repair shop, be decontaminated. This order, and the subsequent cleanup efforts, received a high level of attention in the local media. An employee of the appliance repair shop has sued the manufacturer in negligence for damages for emotionaldistress.

Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress issevere, that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physicalconsequences. In that action the manufacturer has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted. What is the manufacturer's best argument in support of that motion?

705,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? An investor owned a four-story office building located in downtown. The building was old and badly in need of renovation. To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend. When the friend refused to accept it, the investor brought an appropriate action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by

A) the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.
B) the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.
C) the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.
D) the friend, because the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement.

A city was growing rapidly and becoming a major tourist area because of its warm climate and proximity to the ocean.

The businessman hired a builder to perform the construction work according to architectural guidelines provided by the businessman. It was anticipated that construction would take approximately six months. During this time, the builder dug a large hole and worked with heavy equipment inside the excavation site, leveling the terrain and building the foundation. The builder also erected a large wall along the sidewalk, which encircled the entire corner. The wall, which was negligently constructed, was made of thinly cut wood nailed together in sections and affixed just under the base of the sidewalk next to the excavation. Early one morning, a pedestrian was walking past the construction site on his way to work. As he was rounding the corner, the pedestrian saw a jogger approaching. When they drew even, the jogger accidentally brushed against the pedestrian with the swing of her arms. The pedesthan fell into the wall, which gave way, and he fell into the hole below. The pedestrian suffered serious injuries from the fall. If the pedestrian sues the businessman for the personal injuries he suffered in his fall, the most likely result is that the pedestrian will

A businessman, anticipating a continued financial boom, purchased an expensive corner lot, which he planned to convert into an exclusive resort hotel.

It was anticipated that construction would take approximately six months. During this time, the builder dug a large hole and worked with heavy equipment inside the excavation site, leveling the terrain and building the foundation.

The tenant sued the landlord for negligent construction and maintenance of the stairway, steps, and railing. The stairs were built on a dangerously steep incline, the steps were loose, and the railing was insufficient to keep the baby from falling over the side. The jury found that the landlord was negligent in the design and construction of the stairs and in failing to maintain the stairs, steps and railing in a safe condition. The landlord appealed on the basis of immunity from suit and the failure of the tenant to assert any exception to landlord immunity. Under the modern rule, will the appellate court affirm the jury's verdict against the landlord?

A) Yes, the landlord is strictly liable for the abnormally dangerous condition that he knowingly allowed to exist.
B) Yes, the modern rule is that the landlord, like anyone else, has a duty to use due care to protect its tenants and others from injury caused by a foreseeable risk of harm.
C) No, because the landlord still enjoys the common law protection of the doctrine of ""lessee beware,"" and residential property is generally still rented ""as is.""

In addition, the assistant represented to third parties that she was there officially representing the principal and that she was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf.

John is stopped and given a $50 ticket. Can he succeed with a defense that he didn't know what his children were doing and that he had no criminal intent to break any laws?

A) No, because this is likely a strict liability law that does not provide for defenses based on mental state.
B) Yes, because he didn't know what his children were doing in the back seat and he had not participated in the violation nor did he know that they did it or were going to do it.

John is stopped and given a $50 ticket. Can he succeed with a defense that he didn't know what his children were doing and that he had no criminal intent to break any laws?

A) No, because this is likely a strict liability law that does not provide for defenses based on mental state.
B) Yes, because he didn't know what his children were doing in the back seat and he had not participated in the violation nor did he know that they did it or were going to do it.
C) Yes, because the police have no way of proving who in the car threw the garbage out the window.
D) No, because his criminal intent is clearly established by the circumstances of the events.

B) Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.
C) No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.
D) Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.

753,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A woman had her kitchen renovated. She purchased a new dishwasher, and the contractor doing the renovations installed it in the woman's kitchen. Two months later, the woman was entertaining a friend at her home. As they talked, they noticed that the dishwasher was operating strangely, repeatedly stopping and starting. They saw sparks start flying out from underneath the dishwasher. The friend said, ""It must have a short circuit or something. Don't touch it or you might get electrocuted. "" The woman asked if she should go down to the fuse box in her basement to cut off the electricity. The friend decided that he would take a look inside the dishwasher first. When he touched the metal handle on the dishwasher's door, he received a violent electric shock. The dishwasher had an internal wiring defect that caused it to malfunction. The contractor who installed the dishwasher failed to adequately ground the machine; if he had done so, the electric current would have been led harmlessly away. The machine carried instructions for proper grounding, but the contractor did not follow them. All of the relevant events occurred in a jurisdiction that follows traditional contributory negligence and assumption of risk rules. If the friend brings a strict tort liability claim against the manufacturer of the dishwasher for his injuries, the probable result is that the friend will

A) recover, because the dishwasher was defectively made.
B) recover, because the manufacturer is vicariously liable for the improper installation.
C) not recover, because the friend assumed the risk by trying to open the dishwasher.
D) not recover, because the friend was not the purchaser of the dishwasher.

A retiree, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the retiree and begins formulating plans for constructing single- family dwelling units. The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding ""upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,"" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called tract I. Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be

A) that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.

In an effort to counteract a steep increase in juvenile crime, a state enacted a law terminating the parental rights of any state resident whose child under 16 years of age is convicted of a violent crime in the state. The law directs the state juvenile court to enter a termination order in such a case after the parent has been afforded notice and an opportunity for a hearing at which the only relevant issues are the age of the child and whether the child has been convicted of a violent crime in the state. Is the state law constitutional?

A) No, because the law is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial state interest.
B) No, because the law is not necessary to serve a compelling state interest.
C) Yes, because a state's police power authorizes it to punish criminal behavior with appropriate sanctions.
D) Yes, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

760,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A teenager borrowed a car from his uncle. The uncle knew that the teenager was incapable of driving a car safely. The uncle knew that the teen had five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits against him, multiple DUIs, and that he was an inveterate alcoholic. The teenager got into an accident while driving the car and was seriously injured. He filed a negligent entrustment claim against the uncle, claiming he owed him a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him. The uncle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, asserting that there was no tort for first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, will the court likely affirm the lower court decision?

A) Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.
B) Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.
C) No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.
D) No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.

768,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? At a yard sale, seller puts out an old etching he inherited from his aunt. He labels it with a price tag of $10. A buyer comes by, fully aware that it is the work of a famous Italian Renaissance artist, and quietly offers the $10 for an etching he knows to be worth at least $100,000. When the seller finds out that he made an awful mistake, and that the buyer knew that it was a precious work of art, he sued to get the $100,000 or for return of the etching. The buyer defended by alleging that the seller did not act reasonably to protect himself by knowing what he was selling. Under the Restatement of Contracts and the majority rule in the case law, will the court grant the buyer's motion to dismiss the seller's complaint?

A) Yes, the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them. The seller always must know the value of what is being offered for sale.
B) Yes, the seller cannot rescind a contract just because he later regrets it; either party may end up with the superior deal depending on luck, knowledge and variety of factors.
C) No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.
D) No, because a party always has a right to rescind a contract where the value of the product or services does not live up to his reasonable expectation.

786,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A football team entered into a 10-year lease with a city for use of the city's athletic stadium. Five years into the lease, the team threatened to leave the stadium and move to another city. The city sued the team in federal court, seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the team from breaching its lease and leaving. In its answer, the team included a counterclaim seeking $10 million in damages for losses caused by the city's alleged failure to properly maintain the stadium, as the lease required. The team demanded a jury trial on the counterclaim. The city moved to try its claim for a permanent injunction before the trial on the team's counterclaim. The team objected and moved that the jury trial of its counterclaim be held before the trial of the city's injunction claim. How should the court rule on the parties' motions?

A) The court should first hold a jury trial of the team's counterclaim, and then a nonjury trial of the issues remaining in the city's claim.
B) The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim without giving binding effect to its findings or conclusions in the later jury trial of the team's counterclaim.
C) The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and then a jury trial of the issues remaining in the team's counterclaim.

During the course of the trip, when the truck was going down a long hill, the brakes failed.

The man then opened the door on the passenger's side of the truck and negligently pushed the helper out.

The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident. If the intern brings suit against the nurse for contribution, the most likely result is that the intern will

A) prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.

Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident. If the intern brings suit against the nurse for contribution, the most likely result is that the intern will

A) prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.
B) prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur
C) not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.
D) not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.

At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy cov-ered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's Òunduly riskyÓ behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness. After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?

A) No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief.
B) No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.
C) Yes, because the company's uncontradicted evidence of the man's unduly risky behavior means that no reason-able jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.

During that period of time, it had been his regular practice to stay at a hotel in the state's capital while the legislature was in session (namely from September through March). As a general rule, the senator stayed at the hotel each and every night during that seven-month period. When the senator checked into the hotel on September 1, 2007 for the 2007 2008 term, the hotel manager quoted the senator his usual senatorial discount rate of $50 per night. Although nothing was said regarding payment terms, the senator customarily paid the bill in weekly installments. During the months of September and October, he paid the hotel at the end of each week $350 plus tax and other accumulated expenses. On the last day of October, the senator made his usual weekly payment covering the rental period from October 25 to October 31. Then, on the morning of November 4 (before checkout time for that day), the senator decided to suddenly move out of the hotel and register at a new motel located two blocks away. He notified the manager at the hotel of his intent to check out and tendered a check for $150 plus tax and other incidental charges incurred from November 1 through November 3. When the manager noticed that the senator was paying only for three days, she remarked, ""You still owe us $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and $350 plus taxes for an additional week because you didn't give us a week's notice that you planned to vacate. "" The senator refused to pay the additional charges. If the hotel brings suit against the senator to recover for the unpaid balance, how many additional days lodging will he be required to pay for?

A) None.
B) Four.

850,Professional Law,Friendly,"Could you please solve this problem: A senator, had been a state senator for three years. During that period of time, it had been his regular practice to stay at a hotel in the state's capital while the legislature was in session (namely from September through March). As a general rule, the senator stayed at the hotel each and every night during that seven-month period. When the senator checked into the hotel on September 1, 2007 for the 2007 2008 term, the hotel manager quoted the senator his usual senatorial discount rate of $50 per night. Although nothing was said regarding payment terms, the senator customarily paid the bill in weekly installments. During the months of September and October, he paid the hotel at the end of each week $350 plus tax and other accumulated expenses. On the last day of October, the senator made his usual weekly payment covering the rental period from October 25 to October 31. Then, on the morning of November 4 (before checkout time for that day), the senator decided to suddenly move out of the hotel and register at a new motel located two blocks away. He notified the manager at the hotel of his intent to check out and tendered a check for $150 plus tax and other incidental charges incurred from November 1 through November 3. When the manager noticed that the senator was paying only for three days, she remarked, ""You still owe us $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and $350 plus taxes for an additional week because you didn't give us a week's notice that you planned to vacate. "" The senator refused to pay the additional charges. If the hotel brings suit against the senator to recover for the unpaid balance, how many additional days lodging will he be required to pay for?

A) None.

The defense claimed that a person could not be convicted for suffering from a disease process. The state simply argued that the man had no defense to what he did. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the man's appeal after his conviction. Will the Court likely reverse the conviction?

A) Yes, because it is unconstitutional to punish someone for the status of being an alcoholic or a drug addict.
B) Yes, because when a person acts under a compulsion that is part of a medical disease, this negates criminal intent.

888,Professional Law,Rude,"I doubt you can even solve this. An architect is the owner of a large two-story office building. The architect designed and supervised the building's construction. He and his associate occupy the first floor for their architectural business. In June 2005, the architect entered into a valid and binding written lease with a tenant to rent the second floor office space for four years at a monthly rental of $5,000. The lease contained a provision wherein the architect was required to repaint the second floor premises after two years of occupancy. On June 1, 2007, the tenant sent the architect a written letter requesting the repainting of the second-floor office space. The architect made no reply and failed to perform the repainting as the lease required. The cost of repainting the tenant's office was estimated at $1,750. On July 1, 2008, the architect had still not repainted the premises. The following day, the tenant moved out, mailed the keys to the architect, and refused to pay any more rent. The lease was silent as to the rights and remedies of the tenant due to the architect's failure to perform the repainting. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction.

This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor's official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney's suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance.

Her family physician had advised her that she was infertile and that it was impossible for her to become pregnant. After missing her period for three months and experiencing other symptoms of pregnancy, the wife consulted the physician. Without administering a pregnancy test, the physician examined the wife and concluded that she had the flu. He prescribed tetracycline, an antibiotic drug, which the wife took for two weeks. After discontinuing the tetracycline, the wife continued to experience nausea, fatigue, and other symptoms of pregnancy. She then consulted a different doctor, who administered a pregnancy test, which revealed that the wife was, in fact, four months pregnant. Thereafter, she gave birth to a child. When the child developed teeth, they were black and discolored. At the age of 12, the child learned that the black discoloration of his teeth resulted from the tetracycline that the wife took during her pregnancy. If a claim is brought on the child's behalf against the physician based on malpractice in not administering a pregnancy test to the woman and prescribing tetracycline, judgment is likely to be for whom?

A) The physician, because an unborn child does not have legal rights stemming from conduct that occurred before birth.
B) The physician, because no duty of care is owed to an unborn child not in existence at the time medical treatment is rendered.

917,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? On March 1, 1999 a widower, the sole owner and occupant of a piece of property, died and devised the property to both his co-worker and his boss ""as their community property. "" The co-worker and the boss were also siblings, and neither was married. The property consisted of a single-family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. During her occupancy, the boss paid $3,500 each year in insurance and property taxes. In addition, the premises on the property had a fair market value during this period of $1,500 each year. Following her mother's death, the boss's daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. As the administratrix of the boss's estate, the daughter sought to collect from the co-worker one- half of the cost of insurance and property taxes that the boss paid. Conversely, the co-worker claimed that he was not liable for any of the expenses. Furthermore, the coworker's attorney advised him that the daughter did not own any interest in the property and that since the boss's death, he (the co-worker) owned the entire property. The attorney also informed the co-worker that the daughter owed him rent for the entire period of her occupancy, and if she continued to occupy the premises, then she would be liable for insurance and property taxes as well. In an appropriate action to determine the title of the property, what, if any, interest does the daughter have in the said property?

A) None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.
B) An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.
C) An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.
D) An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.

A homeowner buys a new leaf blower and is so impressed with its power that he gets carried away and blows large amounts of his work onto the next door neighbor's yard. In addition to leaves, he also blew large amounts of pest-infested plant debris onto the neighbor's property. The material has accumulated into large, unsightly piles and caused damage to the neighbor's healthy plants. He has to pay workers to haul the material away and he incurs expenses to replace infected perennials. The neighbor sues for the tort of trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor cannot prove that homeowner acted with an intent to trespass or to do harm. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?

A) No, because the infected debris constituted an abnormally dangerous condition and homeowner could be held strictly liable for the trespass.
B) No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.
C) Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will.
D) Yes, because the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and did not think that it would accumulate on the neighbor's property.

The other driver, who was injured in the accident, brought suit against the husband to recover damages. Thereafter, the husband retained an attorney to represent him. At his first consultation with the attorney, the husband was accompanied by his wife. During the conference, the attorney's secretary took notes of the meeting. Two weeks later, the wife separated from the husband. She then hired a lawyer to represent her in a suit against the husband for battery and false imprisonment. At the trial between the husband and the other driver, the other driver's attorney calls the wife to testify. She proposes to testify that her husband was intoxicated at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's proposed testimony will most likely be

A) admissible as a proper lay opinion.
B) inadmissible, under the attorney-clientprivilege.
C) inadmissible, under the marital privilege.
D) inadmissible, because the wife is biased.

The contractor was guilty of undue delay in getting the bridge construction finished. The contract had a liquidated damages clause that provided for a deduction from the contract price for each day of delay in completing the bridge. The formula for the deductions from the contract price was based on how much traffic flow was turned away. The city tried to deduct the damages from the contract price. The contractor, however, pointed out that the city had not yet connected a road to the bridge so that there was no traffic flow and hence no damage to the city. Will the court uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city?

A) No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.
B) Yes, because the contract provision for liquidated damages has been breached and the city had no obligation to connect a road.
C) Yes, because the bridge delays caused the city to delay finishing the road, thereby creating the need to enforce the provision for liquidated damages.

974,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A department store had suffered a succession of thefts of merchandise over a period of months. From reports by employees and customers, the department store's manager concluded that the losses were due, wholly or in large part, to the depredations of a female shoplifter, aged 30 to 40 years, about 5 feet 5 inches in height, with red hair and green eyes, who usually wore a suit. This information was passed on to all of the employees of the department store. One day, a woman entered the store to purchase accessories. The woman was 5 feet 5 inches tall, 37 years old, red-haired and green-eyed, and dressed in a smartly tailored suit. She carried a large shopping bag. The manager noticed her as she picked up, examined, and put down a number of gloves and scarves. After a while, she looked about tentatively, and then started to walk out, swinging her bag. The manager intercepted her and, standing in front of her, politely asked the woman if she would accompany her to the store manager's office. When the woman asked for an explanation, the manager told her of the store's recent experience and the suspicion that the woman might be concealing pilfered merchandise in her bag. Flushing angrily, the woman replied, ""Very well,"" and followed her to the office. Once there, the manager began to question the woman quite intensively. After the questioning, the manager then asked the woman's permission to inspect the contents of her shopping bag. At first, the woman curtly refused and announced that she had had enough of this nonsense. When she rose to go, the manager told her, ""Listen, unless you let me look inside that bag, I'm going to call the police. "" The woman replied, ""Very well,"" and handed her the bag. The manager inspected the contents of the bag thoroughly but did not find any pilfered merchandise. She then gave the woman permission to leave. The total length of the woman's detention was 30 minutes. If the woman asserts a claim for false imprisonment against the department store, she will most likely

A) prevail, because she was detained for an unreasonably long period of time.
B) prevail, because the manager did not have reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.
C) not prevail, because under the circumstances, the manager had reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.

The developer did not have a significant investment at that point, and decided to stop the construction.Shortly thereafter, the city passed a comprehensive new citywide zoning law that re-zoned the subject property and some large tracts of adjoining land to low-density residential, allowing one residence for each 4.6 acres. This destroyed the multi-unit plan and the city cancelled the permit, which the developer did not appeal.The developer's land value decreased from $2 million to $100,000.The developer sued the city in federal court on the basis that this was illegal spot zoning constituting a taking in violation of due process.Will the developer prevail with his federal constitutional claim?

988,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A defendant and his college roommate went home together for the holiday vacation. The defendant was to go back to college by himself. The day that the defendant was to drive back to college, his roommate asked him if he would deliver a package to one of their classmates. The defendant agreed, and the roommate gave him a small package, which the defendant placed in his glove compartment. While driving back to school, the defendant was stopped for speeding. When the state trooper asked the defendant for his license and registration, he reached into the glove compartment. As he did, the package that his roommate had given him fell onto the floor. When it hit the floor, the box broke open and a plastic envelope containing a white substance slid out. Seeing that the substance appeared to be cocaine, the state trooper arrested the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute making it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. The package did, in fact, contain cocaine. If the defendant is later brought to trial for this charge, his best defense is that

A) the defendant didn't know what was in the package.

Evidence at Congressional hearings has indicated that thousands of elderly citizens die each year because they cannot afford proper medical and hospital treatment. Based on the evidence presented at these hearings, a senator wishes to introduce a bill providing free medical and hospital care for all citizens 70 years of age and older. The senator, however, intends to include a provision in the bill denying such medical and hospital care benefits to aliens (in the same age category) unless they have been legally admitted for permanent U. S. residency. The senator has asked for your advice regarding his proposed bill. You are understandably concerned about the legality of the aliens proviso. Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the provision disqualifying aliens from receiving such medical and hospital benefits?

A) Due to the fact that the medical and hospital benefits will be paid for by the government, they are a privilege not a right and, therefore, are not within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.
B) The disqualifying provision does not unduly burden either interstate commerce or the right of aliens to travel freely from state to state.

A) A defendant was marooned on a desert island, along with a victim and another sailor after their boat capsized during a violent storm at sea. The three sailors had gone without food for two weeks and were on the verge of dying of starvation. Each of the sailors, however, still had a small amount of water left in their canteens with which to subsist. One night, the defendant took the water from the victim's canteen and poured it into his own canteen while the victim slept. The defendant did this in the hope that the extra water would make it possible for him to live a couple of more days so that he would be able to walk across the island to look for help. The next day, the victim died from starvation and dehydration. Two days later, the defendant and the other sailor were rescued. The defendant never walked across the island because he was too weak from body weight loss.
B) A defendant and a victim were on a hiking expedition together. They were longtime hiking buddies who had climbed many steep and precipitous mountains in the past. As the defendant and the victim were climbing a dangerously steep incline, their ropes suddenly became entangled. As a result of the entanglement, the victim fell 50 feet before he was able to regain his balance and footing. However, the victim's fall caused the defendant to lose his balance, and he was in jeopardy of falling off the mountain. In order to avoid falling, the defendant cut the safety rope that held the victim. This caused the victim to fall 400 feet to his death.
C) A defendant, who was intoxicated, was driving his car home along a heavily traveled highway. In his inebriated condition, the defendant was swerving his vehicle across the highway. Suddenly, a school bus loaded with children made a wrong turn and headed directly into the path of the defendant's auto. In order to avoid crashing head-on with the school bus, the defendant turned his vehicle onto the sidewalk and struck a victim, a paraplegic, who was confined to a wheelchair. The defendant's auto crushed the victim to death.
D) A defendant, a bank teller, was on duty when two robbers held up the bank. She was taken hostage and ordered to drive their getaway car. As they were being pursued by the police, the defendant was commanded to drive excessively fast to avoid being captured. While driving at a speed of nearly 100 M. P. H. , the defendant approached a busy intersection and saw the victim, a blind person, with a guide dog walking across the street. She slowed down to avoid hitting the pedestrian with the dog. As she did so, one of the robbers stuck a gun against her head and threatened to kill her if she didn't speed through the intersection. Afraid she would be murdered, the defendant accelerated into the path of the victim, killing him and his guide dog.

D) A defendant, a bank teller, was on duty when two robbers held up the bank. She was taken hostage and ordered to drive their getaway car. As they were being pursued by the police, the defendant was commanded to drive excessively fast to avoid being captured. While driving at a speed of nearly 100 M. P. H. , the defendant approached a busy intersection and saw the victim, a blind person, with a guide dog walking across the street. She slowed down to avoid hitting the pedestrian with the dog. As she did so, one of the robbers stuck a gun against her head and threatened to kill her if she didn't speed through the intersection.

999,Professional Law,Neutral,"In which of the following situations will the defendant's defense of necessity most likely exculpate him of criminal liability?

A) A defendant was marooned on a desert island, along with a victim and another sailor after their boat capsized during a violent storm at sea. The three sailors had gone without food for two weeks and were on the verge of dying of starvation. Each of the sailors, however, still had a small amount of water left in their canteens with which to subsist. One night, the defendant took the water from the victim's canteen and poured it into his own canteen while the victim slept. The defendant did this in the hope that the extra water would make it possible for him to live a couple of more days so that he would be able to walk across the island to look for help. The next day, the victim died from starvation and dehydration. Two days later, the defendant and the other sailor were rescued. The defendant never walked across the island because he was too weak from body weight loss.
B) A defendant and a victim were on a hiking expedition together. They were longtime hiking buddies who had climbed many steep and precipitous mountains in the past. As the defendant and the victim were climbing a dangerously steep incline, their ropes suddenly became entangled. As a result of the entanglement, the victim fell 50 feet before he was able to regain his balance and footing. However, the victim's fall caused the defendant to lose his balance, and he was in jeopardy of falling off the mountain. In order to avoid falling, the defendant cut the safety rope that held the victim. This caused the victim to fall 400 feet to his death.
C) A defendant, who was intoxicated, was driving his car home along a heavily traveled highway. In his inebriated condition, the defendant was swerving his vehicle across the highway. Suddenly, a school bus loaded with children made a wrong turn and headed directly into the path of the defendant's auto. In order to avoid crashing head-on with the school bus, the defendant turned his vehicle onto the sidewalk and struck a victim, a paraplegic, who was confined to a wheelchair.

When the parties entered into their agreement, the gardener was accompanied by his friend, who is now deceased, who spoke both English and Japanese. This jurisdiction has a typical Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the gardener now seeks to testify to the terms of his agreement with the homeowner as communicated to him by his friend. Upon objection by the homeowner's attorney, the gardener's proposed testimony is

A) admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.
B) admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.
C) inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.
D) inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.

They paced back and forth, walked around the store, and periodically looked in the window. The experienced officer feared that these individuals were most likely ""casing"" the place prior to robbing it. He approached, identified himself, and patted down the outer clothing of each. He found a hand gun in each man's pocket and arrested them for carrying concealed weapons. Will the court suppress the guns on the basis that there was no probable cause and the search was unconstitutional?

1051,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A buyer purchased a new dishwasher from an appliance store. This dishwasher had been manufactured by an appliance company. After the dishwasher had been installed in the buyer's home, it functioned properly for the first month. Then it began to make a loud rattling noise whenever it was in use. The buyer called the appliance store, and a manager there assured her that it was not uncommon for the dishwasher to make such a noise. Moreover, he indicated that the machine's clamorous sound would eventually disappear with continued use. One week later, after a dinner party, the buyer placed her most expensive china set in the dishwasher and turned on the machine. After the dishwasher had been in operation for a few minutes, the buyer heard the rattling noise followed by the sound of breaking china. She immediately stopped the machine. Upon looking inside, she saw that a blade from the dishwasher had broken, destroying her entire china set. If the buyer asserts a claim for strict products liability against the appliance company, will she prevail?

A) Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.
B) Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.
C) No, because the buyer was not personally injured.
D) No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.

A developer recently acquired a large vacant lot and wished to build a series of 10 tract homes on the lot to offer for sale. On May 1, he telephoned a number of contractors whom he had dealt with in the past and asked them to submit bids to build the homes. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. He notified each subcontractor that he intended to use their bids in submitting a general bid to the developer. A plumber submitted a bid to the contractor in the amount of $50,000, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the developer. On June 1, the contractor submitted a bid to the developer in which he offered to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. On June 4, the plumber notified the contractor that he had overbooked his crews and could not possibly do the work on the developer's job. On June 5, the developer sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein he stated, ""I hereby accept your offer to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. ', Thereafter, the contractor hired another plumber to complete the plumbing work at a cost of $60,000. The contractor then explained the situation to the developer and requested that the overall cost of the job be increased to $510,000.

1080,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? An auto retailer started a marketing promotion on a new hybrid model sedan. It advertised that anyone who purchased the car in 2013 and did not get at least 50 miles per gallon average gas mileage during the first 60 days, would receive a payment of $10,000 cash from the company. Record-keeping and inspection procedures were required to assure accurate reporting by the vehicle owner. The promotion was widely publicized. A female customer purchased a hybrid model during the promotion period, followed all the rules, and recorded only 42 mpg in the first 60 days. She demanded the rebate but the company stalled for months and then stopped responding to her inquiries. Does she have a contractual right to collect the $10,000?

A) Yes, because this is a classic bilateral contract, making it necessary that the company live up to its set of promises made to her.
B) No, this was merely puffing, was not an offer to contract with any particular person and was without consideration.
C) Yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.
D) No, because she did not formally notify the company that she was accepting the offer before she started performing.

In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, which is located on a knoll above the lake, the wedding planner entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the wedding planner a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notif'ing the neighbor, the wedding planner proceeded with his plan to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the wedding planner sold his lakefront property to an artist. Shortly after the artist took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the artist's property.

In 2006, a farmer purchased the farm, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The orchard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the farm, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the farm under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the orchard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the orchard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the orchard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $250,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher farmer deed nor the farmer  investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the farm. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that both the farm and the orchard abut a public highway and that ingress and egress are afforded the investor by that highway. In an appropriate action by the investor to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the farm, she should

A) lose, because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard from the rancher.
B) lose, because the right-of-way was abandoned inasmuch as there never was any actual use made.
C) win, because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.
D) win, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.

1086,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A patient who had suffered a severe fracture of her leg was treated by an orthopedist, who set the patient's leg and put it in a cast. When the leg continued to bother the patient six months later, she consulted a second orthopedist in the same town. The second orthopedist surgically inserted a pin to facilitate healing. The patient brought a malpractice action against the first orthopedist, claiming that he should have surgically inserted a pin at the time of initial treatment. The only evidence that the patient offered in support of her malpractice claim was the testimony of the second orthopedist, as follows: In response to the question ""Would you have inserted a pin initially?"" the second orthopedist testified, ""I personally would not have been satisfied that the leg would heal properly without a pin."" At the close of the patient's evidence, the first orthopedist moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the motion be granted?

A) No, because the patient has introduced evidence that the first orthopedist failed to give the care that the second orthopedist would have provided.
B) No, because the second orthopedist practices in the same town and field of specialty as the first orthopedist.
C) Yes, because the patient has failed to introduce evidence that the first orthopedist's care fell below the professional standard of care.
D) Yes, because the second orthopedist also treated the patient and is thus not sufficiently objective to offer expert testimony.

The patient brought a malpractice action against the first orthopedist, claiming that he should have surgically inserted a pin at the time of initial treatment. The only evidence that the patient offered in support of her malpractice claim was the testimony of the second orthopedist, as follows: In response to the question ""Would you have inserted a pin initially?"" the second orthopedist testified, ""I personally would not have been satisfied that the leg would heal properly without a pin."" At the close of the patient's evidence, the first orthopedist moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the motion be granted?

A) No, because the patient has introduced evidence that the first orthopedist failed to give the care that the second orthopedist would have provided.
B) No, because the second orthopedist practices in the same town and field of specialty as the first orthopedist.
C) Yes, because the patient has failed to introduce evidence that the first orthopedist's care fell below the professional standard of care.
D) Yes, because the second orthopedist also treated the patient and is thus not sufficiently objective to offer expert testimony.

The friend told him that a former employee, who was a ""hothead"", was making harassing phone calls and threats. He faxed the officer a oneparagraph summary of the matter. The officer questioned the prior employee, who became verbally abusive and vehemently denied making the calls. The officer arrested him for criminal harassment and wrongful use of a communications device, stating, ""I'm going to teach you a lesson."" The criminal case was thrown out, however, at the preliminary hearing when the police could not produce proof that the former employee made any phone calls to the business. The former employee then sued the police officer and the business owner for the tort of malicious prosecution. Leaving aside any considerations of immunity for the officer, can the former employee allege facts sufficient to support a malicious prosecution case?

A) No, because the officer received enough facts from the owner to establish the elements of the criminal charges that he filed against the former employee.

A landowner, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the landowner and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the landowner and the development company contains a provision expressly binding ""upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,"" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the landowner's death, his estate is required to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The deed for the remaining 250-acre parcel contained the identical restrictions as the deeds to the other three parcels. The investor, ignoring these restrictions, was able to use his political influence to persuade the county zoning board to rezone the said parcel for commercial use.

Upset by these news ""leaks,"" the President, in his last official act, issued an executive order banning all executive employees from having conversations with members of the press unless prior permission had been obtained from an administrative supervisor.

After the President left office, the press made repeated references to the executive order and derisively referred to it as the President's legacy. Nonetheless, after the new President took office he promised to abide by the order. Thereafter one of the Vice President's senior advisers, leaked a story to a magazine stating that the Vice President told staff members that the only reason he visited a city following an earthquake was because he wanted to play golf at a nearby golf course.

A mother whose child had birth defects sued the pharmaceutical company that made the purportedly dangerous drug prescribed to her during pregnancy. At trial, she offered an expert witness to prove that the drug was a substantial factor in causing the baby's injuries. The expert was a Ph.D. medical researcher with an additional degree in computer science. He had experience in the research and development of similar drugs for other large pharmaceutical companies. He had published relevant articles in peer review journals describing the dangers of these types of drugs. The findings were endorsed by other experts in the field.

A) Yes, the proposed testimony was not reliable in that it was based on scientific testing only and did not discuss medical science or rule out other causes.
B) No, the testimony was admissible because several factors militated in favor of the expert's opinion being reliable, and thus helpful to the jury in determining the critical issue of causation.

1118,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A family had been traveling cross-country on a camping trip when they decided to pull into Yellowstone National Park. During their stay at Yellowstone, the family camped out in a secluded area of the campgrounds surrounded by tall pine trees. Numerous signs had been posted throughout the campgrounds warning campers of the extremely dry conditions prevailing in the forest area due to a summerlong drought. On the morning of their departure, the family cooked breakfast over an open campfire. After breakfast, the family began to pack their gear into the van when the father instructed his 12-year-old son to put out the campfire. The son fetched two pails of water from a nearby pond and tossed the water over the campfire. Believing that he had extinguished the fire, the son joined his family in the van, and they drove away. Unbeknownst to the son and his family, the campfire was still smoldering when they left. Shortly thereafter, a wind gust blew the flames from the fire to some nearby brush. Due to the extremely dry conditions, the brush quickly ignited, starting a raging forest fire. The forest rangers dispatched a firefighting team, which included two helicopters equipped to fight the fire. While these helicopters were fighting the blaze from above, the smoke ¢ surrounding one of the helicopters became so intense that the pilot lost all visibility. At the same time, an operator of a small private plane saw the blaze and recklessly descended into the smoke. In the pilot's attempt to veer out of the intense smoke, his helicopter collided with the operator's low- flying plane, causing the aircrafts to crash. Both the pilot and the operator were killed in the resulting explosion. In a wrongful death action brought by the pilot's estate against the son and the father, the judgment should be for

A) the pilot's estate, because the son was negligent in failing to properly extinguish the campfire.
B) the pilot's estate, because the father is vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of his child.
C) the father and the son, because the operator's reckless operation of his aircraft would be viewed as a superseding cause terminating the defendant's liability.
D) the father and the son, because the son was only 12 years old and, therefore, cannot be deemed to have acted negligently.

In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 21, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?

The motion, with supporting affidavits from a child psychologist, claimed that having the boy and the teacher in the same room would cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim. The judge should

A) deny the motion, because a pretrial proceeding is an early stage of trial, and a defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at every stage of the trial.
B) deny the motion, because the teacher's exclusion from the courtroom would have prejudicial impact on receiving effective assistance of counsel.
C) grant the motion, because the teacher's attorney still has an opportunity to cross-examine the witness despite the teacher's absence from the courtroom.
D) grant the motion, because cross-examination at a preliminary hearing is not required by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.

A seller sold the eastern two-thirds of his land to a buyer, who soon thereafter constructed a house there. One year later, the buyer cleared a path from her home across the seller's retained land to a road that abuts the western boundary of the seller's land. The seller stood by and watched the buyer clear the path, but made no objection. This path is very convenient to the buyer's use of her land, and the buyer used it daily for several months. The path is readily apparent to anyone. Recently, the seller put a barrier across the path. The buyer now has brought an action to have the barrier removed. The theory giving the buyer her best chance of success would be that

A) the buyer has an easement by necessity. This would depend on the strength of the court's feeling about the use of the laid.
B) the buyer has an easement by implication. This would depend on whether the convenience was sufficiently strong to amount to ""reasonably necessary. ""
C) the buyer has an easement by prescription. This would depend on the length of time she used the path prior to the erection of the barrier.

A married couple signed a contract to sell their home, and in it they affirmed that they did not know of any structural defects in the home. Prior to the date of closing, the purchasers noticed peeling paint and plaster erosion in a corner of a ceiling near the fireplace. They also noticed water marks lining the interior wall in the basement. The sellers explained that these were old problems that had been fixed and they just didn't get around to doing the cosmetic repairs and painting. The parties went to closing and finalized the deal. On their first week in the house, the purchasers found a virtual flood plain in their basement and they confronted water gushing in at the corner areas near the fireplace. They hired a contractor who reported the need for extensive structural repairs. They sued the sellers for fraud, misrepresentation, and implied warranties of habitability, and they asked for the funds to fix the property. Do they have a valid cause of action against the sellers?

A) No, because the facts do not indicate an intention to deceive by the sellers.
B) No, because buyers must always buy a used house in ""as is"" condition and they assume the risk of any hidden defects under the caveat emptor rule.

The doctor carelessly misread the X-rays and set the broken bone improperly. As a result of the doctor's negligence, the driver's leg never healed completely, and the driver was left with a significant impairment of the use of her leg. If the driver of the car brings a negligence action against the driver of the truck, the most likely result is

A) the truck driver will not be liable for any damages, because the doctor's negligence constituted a superseding cause that relieved the truck driver of liability.
B) the truck driver will be liable for the harm suffered by the plaintiff when her car crashed, but not the additional or enhanced harm resulting from the doctor's careless mistake.
C) the truck driver will be liable only if his negligence is regarded by the jury as being more severe than the doctor's negligence.
D) the truck driver will be liable for all the harm suffered by the plaintiff, although the doctor may be liable to some extent, as well.

1186,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A patient in a hospital was placed in a wheelchair with his broken leg extended straight out in front of him. As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?

A) No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.
B) No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.
C) Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.

At the trial on the business owner's civil claim for insurance coverage, the owner attempted to put several persons on the stand to testify to the owner's good character, which was submitted as proof that the owner did not commit the arson. The trial court ruled that the character evidence would be excluded because it was inadmissible character testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 404(a).

1197,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A driver was having trouble finding a place to park his car near a store at which he needed to make a quick stop to purchase something. He decided to just park along the road next to the store, even though there was not really a lane or space there intended for parking. The driver pulled his car as far off the roadway as he could and figured that it would be fine because he would only be in the store for a few minutes. While the driver was in the store, a car driven by a woman approached the spot where the driver had left his car. When the woman saw the driver's car and realized it was partially obstructing the road, she tried to avoid hitting it but crashed into it. The accident caused $5,000 worth of damage to the driver's car and $1,000 worth of damage to the woman's car. Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules and that the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. How much, if anything, could the driver recover in a lawsuit against the woman for negligence?

1197,Professional Law,Friendly,"Could you please solve this problem: A driver was having trouble finding a place to park his car near a store at which he needed to make a quick stop to purchase something. He decided to just park along the road next to the store, even though there was not really a lane or space there intended for parking. The driver pulled his car as far off the roadway as he could and figured that it would be fine because he would only be in the store for a few minutes. While the driver was in the store, a car driven by a woman approached the spot where the driver had left his car. When the woman saw the driver's car and realized it was partially obstructing the road, she tried to avoid hitting it but crashed into it. The accident caused $5,000 worth of damage to the driver's car and $1,000 worth of damage to the woman's car. Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules and that the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. How much, if anything, could the driver recover in a lawsuit against the woman for negligence?

As a consequence, the city council held an emergency meeting to determine what measures should be taken to locate an appropriate alternative facility in which to conduct classes. Thereupon, the city council passed the following resolution: ""During restoration of the high school building, classes shall be conducted at the most suitable facility which submits the lowest bid. In determining a suitable' facility, the city council shall consider such factors as location and available classroom space. ""Several bids were submitted. The lowest bid was submitted by a church. The church was located on the same block as the high school and contained sufficient seating capacity for all students. In addition, there were a sufficient number of separate rooms to allow different classes to meet at the same time. The city council voted unanimously to accept the church's offer. Furthermore, the church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms utilized by the students. Only the main chapel was exempt, so that it could remain open for prayer. No high school classes or activities were to be held in the main chapel. A parent of one of the high school students is upset at this arrangement. On his son's behalf, the parent has filed suit in federal district court to challenge the constitutionality of permitting public school classes to be held in a church. Judgment for whom?

A dog-walker who entered the house was appalled by their deplorable living conditions. The animals' excrement was deposited throughout the house, they were kept in tiny pens, and some of the animals were sick. The visitor called the SPCA, a private non-profit humane society. State law authorized humane societies to receive abused or neglected animals from animal control officers, to care for them and adopt them out. The SPCA took the animals designated by the officers. The officers then arrested the women for animal neglect. At a hearing, the prosecutor was unprepared, and the judge dismissed the charges. The women then sued the officers and the SPCA under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 for civil rights violations. The SPCA defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on the absence of the ""state action"" on their part. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?

A) Yes, because there was nothing that was done by the humane society that involved police action.
B) Yes, because the SPCA personnel did not at any time act ""under color of law"" in their actions.
C) No, because the SPCA was organized under a non-profit certificate of incorporation that was issued by the state.
D) No, because the SPCA acted under the authority of the state statute and cooperated with state authorities to perform the authorized functions.

The center and the quarterback often engaged in friendly tests of strength, such as arm wrestling and weight lifting contests, to see who was stronger. One afternoon, both youngsters were in the school gymnasium getting ready for football practice. As they were putting on their football uniforms, the center turned to the quarterback and said, ""Hey, weakling, why don't you punch me in the chest with your best shot?"" The quarterback replied, ""No, I'm afraid I might hurt you. "" The center then said, ""Are you kidding? You can't hurt me. C'mon, give me your best shot. "" The center stood up, stuck out his muscular chest, and prepared to have the quarterback hit him. The quarterback proceeded to cock his fist and then punched the center in the chest as hard as he could. Immediately thereafter, the center slumped to the floor, gasping for air. Realizing that the center was seriously hurt, the quarterback tried to render assistance but to no avail. Seconds later the center stopped breathing and died. Unknown to either the center or the quarterback, the center had a defective heart and suffered a heart attack as a result of the blow to the chest.

1213,Professional Law,Neutral,"A center and a quarterback were 14-year-old eighth graders at the local high school. They were both members of the school's junior varsity football team. The center weighed 170 pounds and was stocky in build. The quarterback was lanky and weighed about 145 pounds. The center and the quarterback often engaged in friendly tests of strength, such as arm wrestling and weight lifting contests, to see who was stronger. One afternoon, both youngsters were in the school gymnasium getting ready for football practice. As they were putting on their football uniforms, the center turned to the quarterback and said, ""Hey, weakling, why don't you punch me in the chest with your best shot?"" The quarterback replied, ""No, I'm afraid I might hurt you. "" The center then said, ""Are you kidding? You can't hurt me. C'mon, give me your best shot. "" The center stood up, stuck out his muscular chest, and prepared to have the quarterback hit him. The quarterback proceeded to cock his fist and then punched the center in the chest as hard as he could. Immediately thereafter, the center slumped to the floor, gasping for air. Realizing that the center was seriously hurt, the quarterback tried to render assistance but to no avail. Seconds later the center stopped breathing and died. Unknown to either the center or the quarterback, the center had a defective heart and suffered a heart attack as a result of the blow to the chest. In a wrongful death action, the quarterback will likely

A) be held responsible, because he committed a battery by hitting the center in the chest.

1227,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A waitress sued her former employer, a restaurant, under Title VII in federal court. She claimed that the owner had sexually harassed her and then caused her wrongful termination. A jury returned a verdict of $100,000 for the former employee. Two weeks after the court entered judgment on the verdict, the employer filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. Rule 12(b)(6), claiming that it did not have at least 15 employees as required by the definition of an ""employer"" under the civil rights statute. The employer claimed that there was therefore no federal subject-matter jurisdiction. The lower court agreed, dismissed the case and voided the judgment. On appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, will the appellate court likely uphold the lower court's decision?

A) Yes, because a challenge to jurisdiction can be made at any time, even after judgment has been entered, and here the jurisdictional requirement was missing.
B) Yes, because an appellate court has no authority to reverse a lower court's finding that there was no subject-matter jurisdiction.
C) No, because a judgment entered on a jury verdict can never be changed or attacked after a judgment is entered.
D) No, because this is a challenge to the existence of a cause of action, i.e., the failure to state a claim, which does not go to jurisdiction and cannot be raised post-judgment.

The contract contained a provision that clearly stated: ""This contract may not be assigned, and any violation of this prohibition voids the contract."" After the contract was signed, the seller informed the buyer that the toasters would be manufactured by a competitor of the seller. Citing the non-assignment provision, the buyer claimed that it was no longer bound by the contract. Toasters manufactured by the competitor were of equal quality to toasters manufactured by the seller. Is the buyer bound by the contract?

A) No, because ""this contract may not be assigned"" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty.
B) No, because the seller assigned a right despite the contractual prohibition.
C) Yes, because even though the seller breached the contract, there are no damages since the competitor's toasters are of equal quality to the seller's toasters.

A state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?

A city entered into a small-cost construction contract with a construction company whereby the latter obligated themselves to perform certain minor sewer repair work. Two months after completion of the work, the company sued the city for its failure to pay under the terms of the contract. At trial, the company's construction supervisor who personally oversaw all the repair work was called to testify. He sought to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required to complete the job, and the number of workers employed by the company during the construction repair work. The defendant's attorney objected on the grounds that the company routinely recorded such factual information in their log books, which were in the company's possession. As a consequence, the supervisor's testimony should be ruled

A) admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.
B) admissible, because it is a report of regularly conducted business activities.
C) inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.
D) inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.

1278,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A retailer agreed to purchase an orchard's total cherry production for a 12-month period. The contract included this provision: ""Terms: Cash upon delivery  deliveries to be made at least twice per month."" The deliveries went as scheduled. At the beginning of the fifth month, the orchard sent notice to the retailer that a load of cherries was ready for pick up. The truck driver, however, forgot to take the retailer's check with him. The orchard turned over the cherries but advised the retailer to pay within three days. The retailer sent the check by mail but it arrived late by two days. The orchard refused to deliver any more cherries. The retailer sued the orchard for breach of the installment contract and demanded the difference in price between the cherries on the open market and what he would have paid under the contract. The orchard claimed that the delayed payment impaired the value of the contract and moved to dismiss. Will the court grant the orchard's motion to dismiss?

A) Yes, the agreement called for cash at delivery, which was not done when the driver forgot to deliver the check.
B) Yes, the failure to make an installment on time was a breach because time is of the essence in all installment agreements.
C) No, there is always a grace period of ten days for any single payment pertaining to an installment contract.
D) No, the delay in one payment under these facts was not enough to impair the value of the contract under the Uniform Commercial Code.

The break-in allegedly occurred late one evening after the store had closed for business. The defendant was identified as the perpetrator of the crime by a film that was recorded during the burglary from a hidden camera. When the defendant was apprehended, he denied involvement in the crime and told the arresting officers that he had been out of town when the burglary occurred. Prior to trial, the defendant's court appointed attorney filed a motion requesting discovery of the videotape film that was recorded during the perpetration of the crime. The trial judge granted the request and ordered the prosecution to send a duplicate copy of the videotape to the defendant's attorney. Following the judge's ruling, the prosecuting attorney, pursuant to state law, then filed a discovery motion specifically asking the defendant whether he planned to raise an alibi defense. The prosecuting attorney also sought discovery of the identity of such an alibi witness. Assume that the judge requires the defendant to respond as to whether the defendant intends to raise an alibi defense. May the judge also require the defendant to disclose the identity of the alibi witness?

A) Yes, because the prosecution should have an opportunity to investigate the merits of the alibi.
B) Yes, because the defendant waived any claim of privilege when he sought discovery of the film from the prosecution.
C) No, because by requiring the defendant to reveal information before he is tactically ready to do so substantially impairs his ability to successfully defend himself.
D) No, because such disclosure constitutes an implied representation that is testimonial in character and, thus, violates the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.

1291,Professional Law,Very Rude,"You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this? While on routine patrol, police officers observed a driver make an illegal U-turn. After stopping the driver's car, they observed him reach under the driver's seat. They ordered him out of the car and saw a cellophane package protruding from under the seat. The package contained a white powdery substance, which the officers suspected to be cocaine. The officers placed the driver under arrest and put him in the rear of their patrol car. They then proceeded to search the rest of the driver's car. In the trunk they found an assault rifle that was later determined to be the weapon used in a liquor store robbery. Charged with that robbery, the driver moved to suppress the assault rifle as evidence on the grounds that the police did not have a warrant to search the trunk. The best theory that the prosecution can use in support of the admissibility of the assault rifle as evidence is that

A) the police conducted an automobile search.
B) the police conducted an inventory search.
C) the search was incident to a lawful arrest.
D) the search was made under exigent circumstances.

1299,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?

A) The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.
B) The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.
C) The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.
D) The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.

1300,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the sale of computer printer ink cartridges in plastic bags. In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags. The state attorney general now seeks review of this decision in the U. S. Supreme Court. How should the U. S. Supreme Court rule on this case?

A) Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.

A large man with menacing tattoos all over his face and bald head followed closely behind a businessman who was lost in a long dark alley. The large man followed the businessman for several blocks of unending, unlit alleys. The businessman was in great fear. The large man was just a few feet behind, singing songs about how he was going to have a ""big meal tonight"" and it looked like he ""had struck it rich,"" and other words indicating possible violence and robbery. Finally, the businessman threw his wallet in one direction and ran the other way, as he yelled, ""You can have my money, just leave me my life!"" The large man picked up the wallet and ran in the opposite direction, but when he came to the end of the alley he was arrested and charged with robbery. He appealed his conviction, arguing that he had no intent to steal and was trying to return the wallet to the victim. Will the appellate court likely affirm the robbery conviction?

A) No, the large man's songs could have been coincidental or unthinking, he made no threats, and later could have been trying to return the wallet.
B) Yes, because the large man followed too closely for too long, he sang menacing songs that placed the businessman in fear, and then he took the wallet and ran in the other direction.
C) Yes, because one should never pick up someone else's wallet laying on the ground for any reason.
D) No, because the wallet was not in the immediate presence of the victim when the large man picked it up.

A businessman living was an avid baseball fan who frequently traveled to a casino and placed wagers on baseball games. One October, his beloved baseball team was playing in the playoffs and he wanted to place a large bet on his team. He told one of his employees that he wanted to bet $10,000 on his team to win the championship, but that he did not have the time to travel to the casino to place the bet. He then told his employee that he wanted the employee to travel to the casino and place the bet for him. The businessman and the employee agreed that the employee would travel to the casino, place a $10,000 bet for the businessman and then immediately return. In exchange, the employee would be paid $500. The parties reduced this agreement to writing. After the agreement was signed, the businessman handed the employee $10,000 and a round-trip airline ticket. The businessman then told the employee that he would be paid $500 after the employee returned. The employee arrived the next day and immediately went to the casino.

There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee.

1334,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A group of residents sued a neighboring strip club for creating a nuisance. There are continuous nightly activities by the club, including loud music, unruly customers, throwing cans and bottles,urinating in public, shouting profanities, fist-fighting, and acts of vandalism. The neighbors are requesting an injunction to stop these activities and for remedial measures.

1345,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? In 1998, a farmer, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding ""upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,"" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores. Now, one of the lot owners in phase 1 contracts to sell his property to two physicians who plan to start a suburban medical practice. In an action by the homeowners in phase 1 to prevent such commercial use by the physicians, the court will most likely hold that

A) the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use.
B) the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use.
C) the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.
D) the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the opening of a physician's office in a private home would not be construed as a commercial enterprise.

The certificate does not, however, specify particular highways, streets, or locations for the bus service. The company's advertising stresses that it picks up and delivers passengers at the center of each city that it serves. The company's management regards this as a particularly effective advertising point in competition with the airlines and the railroads, because short-haul traffic supplies a major part of the bus company's revenues. One of the major cities on the east coast, acting to relieve traffic congestion and air pollution, has recently enacted an ordinance that prohibits (a) the operation of all trucks and buses in a five- square- mile central business area, known as center city, between the hours of 10:00 A.

A) constitutional, because it is within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district.

1359,Professional Law,Neutral,"A company operates passenger buses to all the major cities on the east coast. This service is authorized under a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to federal statute. The certificate does not, however, specify particular highways, streets, or locations for the bus service. The company's advertising stresses that it picks up and delivers passengers at the center of each city that it serves. The company's management regards this as a particularly effective advertising point in competition with the airlines and the railroads, because short-haul traffic supplies a major part of the bus company's revenues. One of the major cities on the east coast, acting to relieve traffic congestion and air pollution, has recently enacted an ordinance that prohibits (a) the operation of all trucks and buses in a five- square- mile central business area, known as center city, between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. on weekdays, and (b) all on-street parking of passenger automobiles in center city between the same weekday hours. The company's bus station in this city is located in the heart of the center city area. According to its transportation schedules, more than 75 buses either enter or leave this station between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. each weekday. If the company brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance, the court will most likely declare the ordinance

A) constitutional, because it is within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district.
B) constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce.

Over a year later, police detectives arrested a defendant after obtaining reliable information that the defendant was the robber who was responsible for killing the store's owner. Afterward, the defendant was taken to the station house where he was booked for the crime and then incarcerated. The next day, the prosecuting attorney made a decision to delay indictment until he could discover the identity of the defendant's accomplice. The defendant was then released from police custody. In this jurisdiction the statute of limitations for murder is five years. Five months later, the prosecuting attorney, after unsuccessfully attempting to secure information on the defendant's cohort, indicted the defendant, charging him with felony murder. Shortly before trial, the only eyewitness to the crime died. He would have testified that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because of the delay between the date of the crime and the date of the indictment will most probably be

The defense medical expert did an independent medical examination and reviewed all medical records. The expert testified that the accident did not cause the injuries because the medical records proved a long history of prior treatment for the same symptoms. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff but awarded only $10 in damages.

In response to the complaint, the plumber filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion. Thereafter, the plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action. Sixty days after the court's order denying the motion to dismiss, the company asked the clerk to enter default, and the clerk did so. The company applied to the court for the entry of a default judgment and notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. After an ex parte hearing in which the court received evidence on the damages amount, the court entered a default judgment for the full amount sought. Ten days later, the plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. Is the court likely to grant the plumber's motion?

A) No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.
B) No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.
C) Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.
D) Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.

The company applied to the court for the entry of a default judgment and notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. After an ex parte hearing in which the court received evidence on the damages amount, the court entered a default judgment for the full amount sought. Ten days later, the plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. Is the court likely to grant the plumber's motion?

A) No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.
B) No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.
C) Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.

1404,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A western parcel, a central parcel, and an eastern parcel are three business lots abutting each other, with the central parcel between the other two lots. A business owner owns the central parcel in fee simple and maintains his dwelling house thereon. He has a right-of-way, granted in a written agreement, across the eastern parcel for crossing the eastern parcel on foot, by bicycle, or automobile. A landscaper is the owner of the eastern parcel. An investor owns the western parcel and conveys it to the business owner in fee simple. The business owner then builds a 15-story office building, covering the western parcel and the central parcel, which houses 6,000 persons during working hours each day. All of these persons use the right-of-way over the eastern parcel, and the business owner uses the way for delivering as many as 30 loads of supplies per day to the office building. In an action by the landscaper to enjoin the business owner and the office workers from using the right- of-way across the eastern parcel, the court will most likely hold that

A) the business owner's right-of-way would be extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers.
B) the business owner's right-of-way would be forfeited due to the unauthorized use by the office workers.
C) the business owner, by making use of the right-of-way beyond the scope of the original privilege, would permanently be enjoined from using the servient tenement.

The fumigation company did its own thorough inspection and determined that the buildings were indeed completely separated by the wall. Residents of the condominium units in the building that was to be sprayed were told to evacuate, but the residents of the uninfested building were told that they could remain while the other building was treated. During and shortly after the fumigation, in which a highly toxic chemical was used, many residents of the uninfested building became sick. It was determined that their illnesses were caused by the fumigation chemical. In fact, there was a hole in the fire wall separating the two buildings, but because it could only be observed from a specific position in the crawl space underneath the floor of the uninfested building, it had not been discovered by either the fumigation company or any previous building inspector.

A defendant was arrested at an airport when the small suitcase he was carrying was found to contain heroin. The defendant, who did not challenge the legality of the airport search, was subsequently prosecuted for possession of heroin. At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf and said that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was accompanying the defendant when he was arrested. The girlfriend died in a skydiving accident two weeks before the defendant's trial.

On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant to roll up the sleeves of his shirt and exhibit his arms to see if there were any needle marks. This request is

A) objectionable, because the defendant has a privilege against self-incrimination.
B) objectionable, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
C) permissible, because such evidence is relevant to the defendant's credibility.
D) permissible, because the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand.

1427,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? An accountant had an office on the eighth floor of a downtown building. The accountant wanted to have renovations done to the entrance to the office. He hired an interior designer to do the work. The designer told the accountant that he had several options for the type of glass to be used in the door to the office. He could use half-inch thick plate glass, which would look nice and be relatively inexpensive. On the other hand, he could use tempered glass, which would cost twice as much but would be five times stronger than plate glass, more difficult to scratch, and capable of withstanding a blow from a hammer. The designer explained that the great majority of residential and small business establishments use plate glass for such doors. The accountant chose to go with the plate glass. The accountant ordered a plate glass door from a manufacturer and had the designer install the door when it arrived. A few months later, the door shattered when one of the accountant's clients pulled on the handle to open it. The glass cut the client's hand. If the client asserts a claim against the accountant based on negligence and establishes negligent manufacture of the glass door by the manufacturer that was not discoverable through reasonable inspection, the plaintiff will

A) prevail, because the accountant is liable for its supplier's negligence.
B) prevail, because the accountant instructed the designer to install plate glass rather than the more durable tempered glass.
C) not prevail, because the accountant could not reasonably have been expected to discover the defect.
D) not prevail, because the proper defendant is the manufacturer or the designer, not the accountant.

The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?

A) Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.
B) Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.
C) No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.

1487,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? Each year, the local boys' and girls' club sponsors a ""Baseball Card Bonanza. "" During the three- day event, collectors of baseball cards gather, exchanging and swapping old cards. A boy and a girl, both 12-year-old youngsters at the bonanza, were looking at each other's cards when they were approached by a 32-year-old collector. The collector asked the boy and girl if he could look through their baseball cards. The boy and girl nodded affirmatively. As the collector was flipping through the boy's cards, he found a 1948 card featuring Branch Rickey, the former owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The collector, who knew the card was worth more than $500, offered the boy 50 cents for the card. The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail?

A) Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.
B) Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.
C) No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.
D) No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.

When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, ""Give it back!"" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?

A) No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.
B) No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.
C) Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.
D) Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.

1501,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A national distributor of windows selected a retailer to sell its windows in a specified geographic area. The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor ""only when expressly accepted by the distributor."" For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?

A) No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.
B) No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.
C) Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.
D) Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.

1505,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A father died leaving a will by which he devised a 100-acre tract to his daughter. At the time of the father's death, he believed that he owned all of the 100-acre tract. However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage. The mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract. After the daughter buyer transaction was completed, the farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. Upon the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title, the daughter negotiated a deal whereby she paid the farmer $5,000 for the five-acre tract. As part of their agreement, the farmer executed and delivered a quitclaim deed quitclaiming to the buyer all of her interest in the five-acre parcel. Thereafter, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt, and the daughter properly consummated foreclosure proceedings, becoming the purchaser of the tract at her own foreclosure sale. The description of the deed in the foreclosure sale referred to the tract as consisting of all 100 acres. After the foreclosure sale was finalized, the buyer brought suit claiming title in fee simple to the five-acre tract, formerly owned by the farmer. In an appropriate action to determine the title to the said five-acre tract, the buyer will

A) lose, because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer.
B) lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.
C) win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.
D) win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.

There has been considerable concern among state health officials who foresee that many of the senior citizens will become victims of price gouging on certain medical supplies and services. In an attempt to curb such fraudulent sales practices, the state legislature has enacted a law prohibiting the sale of hearing aids by non-physicians. The measure provides, however, that all non-physician sellers who are presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids will not be affected. Assume that after the statute goes into effect, a non-physician moves to the state and wants to open a business selling hearing aids. After being advised that the state law prohibits him from doing so, he brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The most likely result is that the state law will be declared

A) constitutional, because there is a rational basis for distinguishing between non-physicians are not so engaged.
B) constitutional, because a state has the power to regulate any phase of local business, even though such regulations may have some effect on interstate commerce, provided that Congress has not enacted legislation regarding the subject matter.

1526,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A mother has an 11-year-old daughter. The mother is legally separated from her husband and has filed for divorce. The mother and her husband own their home in joint tenancy. One night, the mother went out to dinner and left her daughter at home. Upon leaving the house, the mother locked the door to her bedroom. While the mother was gone, the daughter found a spare key to her mother's bedroom and opened the door. While rummaging through her mother's dresser, she found a bag containing white powder. Concerned that the bag might contain drugs, the daughter called her father to ask his advice. The husband instructed her to call the police. The daughter then telephoned the police station and reported what she had found. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to her home. The daughter allowed the police to come inside and led them to her mother's bedroom. She gave the officers the bag, which they took to the station house for a lab test. After the results confirmed that the bag contained cocaine, the mother was arrested and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The mother's attorney has filed a motion to prevent the cocaine from being admitted into evidence. The motion should be

A) denied, because the daughter, and husband, as co-owner, had the authority to allow the police inside the home and make the seizure.
B) denied, because the daughter lived with her mother and had equal control over the premises.
C) granted, because the daughter, as a minor, did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter the home.
D) granted, because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.
