Indians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.

It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.
—Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542

A) Converting the natives to Christianity
B) Financial gain
C) Personal glory
D) Finding new mates

""In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.""

Not only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: ""I do not know him""; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, ""He is a man I never see""; and from these judgments there was no appeal.
No one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.
He loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.

The passage below is written by John Calvin.
If we need to be recalled to the origin of election, to prove that we obtain salvation from no other source than the mere goodness of God, they who desire to extinguish this principle, do all they can to obscure what ought to be magnificently and loudly celebrated, and to pluck up humility by the roots. In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.

""In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft.

We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.

Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.
His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:
""Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything!

One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry.

""Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing…the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack….The attack yesterday…has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas….As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.""

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price.

531,High School World History,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? This question refers to the following information.
In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.
Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s
The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

According to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?

A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""

I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.
Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s
The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is

A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.
B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.

Soon afterwards, a fire spread from an adjoining building to the leased property, completely destroying the building thereon. While the tenant was in possession of the leased property, he carried a fire insurance policy on the premises in the amount of $100,000.

At the trial on the man's claim, the man was unable to produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage, but established the following by undisputed evidence: (a) that his mother and the testator had cohabited for a number of years; and (b) that his mother had predeceased the testator by one day. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the man's attorney called a clerk at a winter resort hotel. The clerk testified that the testator and the man's mother had come to the hotel for many years and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as ""Mr. and Mrs. Testator. ""The trial court should rule the clerk's testimony

A) admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.
B) admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.
C) inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence.
D) inadmissible, under the Dead Man's Statute.

At 1:00 a. m. one night, two police officers were driving past a tavern when they noticed a man vomiting outside. They stopped their patrol car and walked over to the man, whom they recognized as a troublemaker from the neighboring town. Realizing that the man was extremely intoxicated, they grabbed him and shoved him into their patrol car. They drove the man around in the police car for a few minutes and told him he had two choices. They would either take him to jail for the night or drive him to the city limits and drop him off there. The man indicated that he didn't want to go to jail. One of the officers then said, ""Does that mean you want us to drop you off at the city limits?"" The man replied, ""Yes. "" They then drove him to the city limits and left him along a busy highway. Moments later, the man staggered onto the street and was struck by a car driven by a motorist. He suffered multiple injuries. If the man asserts a claim against the police department based on negligence, he will most likely

A) recover, because the police should have realized it was dangerous to drop him off where they did.

The officers approached the defendant and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. The defendant asked what for, and the police explained that they were narcotics agents assigned to the airport and that he fit the profile of a drug courier. They then asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. The officers then explained that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant told the officers that he changed his mind and decided not to fly today after all. The officers still requested that the defendant turn his overnight bag over to them.

During spring break, a private boarding school was deserted while students and teachers were away on vacation. A guidance counselor remained on campus because he was working on a research project. After working late one night, the counselor decided to enter the room of a student from a very wealthy family. The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin. The police did not secure a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student was thereafter arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The student's attorney has filed a motion to suppress the heroin from evidence. The motion will most likely be

A) granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.
B) granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.
C) denied, because the search was conducted by a private party.
D) denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.

The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin. The police did not secure a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student was thereafter arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The student's attorney has filed a motion to suppress the heroin from evidence. The motion will most likely be

A) granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.
B) granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.
C) denied, because the search was conducted by a private party.
D) denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.

An aspiring actress, whose auditions had not been going well, was forced to pawn her mother's pearls to pay rent and buy food. She finally got good news when her agent told her that she had landed a part in a big movie. Delighted, the actress went down to the pawnshop to retrieve her mother's pearls. When she arrived, the clerk told her that she needed to have cash in order to retrieve the necklace. As she had not been paid yet for the movie, the actress called her agent and told him her dilemma. The agent told her he would come down to the pawnshop and fix everything. When the agent arrived, the actress was still arguing with the clerk. The agent pulled the actress aside and told her that he would distract the clerk while the actress snatched the necklace. The agent then pretended to be interested in an antique lighter, and the actress snatched her necklace off the counter and left the store. The agent is subsequently prosecuted for larceny.

As a result, since the city provided educational benefits to the children of illegal aliens, the school fee furthered a significant governmental interest. The illegal alien, who is indigent, is unable to pay the city school fee. The city will not allow her children to attend school unless the fee is paid. If she seeks your legal advice regarding the constitutionality of the fee, you should advise her that the ordinance is

A) valid, because the city can demonstrate that the school fee is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest.
B) valid, because the imposition of the school fee is substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest.
C) invalid, because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.
D) invalid, because the cost of educating the children imposed an undue burden on the public school system by requiring the school board to hire additional bilingual teachers.

3309,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A scientist used his car to transport a large quantity of highly flammable petroleum derivatives that he needed for his scientific research. The petroleum derivatives were sold in ordinary glass gallon jugs. Shortly after putting the jugs in the back of his car, the scientist was driving along a city street. He was thinking about a difficult scientific question and not paying attention to his driving. As a result, he lost control of the car and drove up onto the sidewalk. The car flipped over. The glass jugs in the back of the car were broken, and the chemicals in them spilled out onto the sidewalk. Moments later, a doctor who witnessed the accident came running over to render medical assistance. As he approached the overturned car, however, the doctor slipped on the petroleum derivatives that had spilled onto the sidewalk. The doctor fell and fractured his ankle. If the doctor asserts a claim against the scientist based on strict liability, will the doctor prevail?

A) Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.
B) Yes, because the transportation of flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs necessarily involves a high degree of risk of serious harm.
C) No, because the doctor assumed the risk by voluntarily acting as a Good Samaritan.
D) No, because it was unforeseeable that the doctor's injury would result from the type of harm threatened.

3313,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? After months of negotiations, the United States and Canada entered into a tax treaty that provided that neither country would impose income taxes on citizens of the other nation. The treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, was supported by professional baseball and hockey players. Many Canadian hockey players, who were employed by American teams and lived in the United States during the hockey season, lobbied for passage of the treaty, since they were subject to the payment of both U. S. and Canadian income taxes. In like manner, many American baseball players, who lived in Canada during the baseball season, objected to the same dual taxation. In violation of the treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U. S. citizen who resided in Canada, of illegally evading the payment of Canadian income taxes. The U. S. citizen, who was a member of a Canadian baseball team, resided in Canada during the baseball season. Following his conviction, the President announced that the previously effective tax treaty would no longer be abided by the United States. The President proclaimed that Canada's refusal to honor the treaty rendered it invalid. As a result, the President ordered the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income taxes from Canadian citizens residing in the United States in the same manner that it collects taxes from other residents of this country. A Canadian citizen and resident of the United States, sues in an appropriate federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the treaty with Canada remains valid and effective. Therefore, he contends that the Internal Revenue Service may not collect U. S. income taxes from him. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional basis that may be urged in support of this claim?

A) The President's unilateral termination of a treaty benefiting residents of the United States cannot be effective until a hearing is afforded to persons who would be affected by such action.
B) The courts have exclusive authority to determine whether a particular treaty has, in fact, been breached by another nation.
C) A ratified treaty is the supreme law of the land and, therefore, remains effective until superseded by another treaty or statute.

Assuming that no train was coming, he proceeded across the railroad tracks. Suddenly, an oncoming train struck the man's car, completely demolishing it. The man was dead on arrival at the local hospital. Unknown to the man, the railroad crossing guard, in a drunken stupor, had fallen asleep at the barrier controls. He failed to see or hear the signals from the oncoming train that struck and killed the man. The railroad company was well aware of the crossing guard's alcoholism, but continued to employ him. However, two weeks after the accident occurred, the railroad company fired the crossing guard. The executor of the man's estate institutes a wrongful death action against the railroad company. During the trial, the attorney for the man's estate offered into proof the fact that the defendant railroad company dismissed the crossing guard shortly after the accident. Upon objection by the railroad company's attorney, the court should

A) overrule the objection, as the employee's dismissal was an admission that the railroad company was aware of the crossing guard's chronic alcoholism.
B) overrule the objection, as an adoptive admission by conduct.
C) sustain the objection, because the probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
D) sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible.

3319,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A farmer owns a large farm on which he allows his friends to hunt during quail-hunting season. He does not provide his friends with any instructions about gun safety. The neighbor who owns property adjacent to the farm knows of the friends' use of the property during the hunting season. One day during the hunting season, without the farmer's knowledge or permission, the neighbor took a shortcut across the farm to visit an acquaintance. The neighbor was wounded by a shot fired by one of the farmer's friends, who was shooting at quail and carelessly failed to see the neighbor. Traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability apply. In an action by the neighbor against the farmer to recover for the injuries, will the neighbor be likely to prevail?

A) No, because the farmer is not responsible for his friends' conduct.
B) No, because the neighbor was trespassing.
C) Yes, because the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training.
D) Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.

Thereafter, the defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self- defense under the battered women's syndrome. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?

A) No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.
B) No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.

3360,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A rancher is the owner of a ranch situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is a 40-acre farm that is owned by a farmer. There is a stream, which is a non-navigable watercourse, that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into the valley below. Both the ranch and the farm are within the watershed of the stream. When the farmer purchased the farm in 1974, he began taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1974, the southern half of the farm had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and unused except for an occasional hike or gathering of timber for use as domestic fuel. The farmer continued this established pattern of use. Now (January 2010), he is still taking water from the stream and using it to irrigate the southern half of the farm. In 2008, the rancher built a home on the ranch and began taking water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. The next year, however, there was a drought. As a result, the stream flowed at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the farmer's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one quarter of the farmer's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. Inasmuch as the stream is still flowing at a very low level and the rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs, there is insufficient water to irrigate the farm. As a consequence, the farmer brings an appropriate action to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher.

3360,Professional Law,Friendly,"Could you please solve this problem: A rancher is the owner of a ranch situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is a 40-acre farm that is owned by a farmer. There is a stream, which is a non-navigable watercourse, that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into the valley below. Both the ranch and the farm are within the watershed of the stream. When the farmer purchased the farm in 1974, he began taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1974, the southern half of the farm had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and unused except for an occasional hike or gathering of timber for use as domestic fuel. The farmer continued this established pattern of use. Now (January 2010), he is still taking water from the stream and using it to irrigate the southern half of the farm. In 2008, the rancher built a home on the ranch and began taking water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. The next year, however, there was a drought. As a result, the stream flowed at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the farmer's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one quarter of the farmer's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. Inasmuch as the stream is still flowing at a very low level and the rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs, there is insufficient water to irrigate the farm. As a consequence, the farmer brings an appropriate action to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher.

Because of this increased work load, the Court has complained that it is unable to properly review all of its cases. As a consequence, Congress formed a committee to conduct a study on improving the functioning and operation of the Court. Based on the committee's recommendations, Congress enacted a statute dividing the Court into two panels. One panel would be assigned to handle criminal cases exclusively, while the other panel would handle all non-criminal matters.

Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute?

A) The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.

The contractor contacted all of the subcontractors she had worked with in the past, informed them of the specifics of the school construction project, and asked each to submit a bid for the work they would be requested to perform. An insulation company submitted a bid of $25,000 to do the required insulation work in the new school. Based on that and other subcontract bids, the contractor prepared a general bid and submitted it to the city. Three days after the contractor submitted the bid to the city, the insulation company notified the contractor that it had overbooked its workforce and would be unable to perform the insulation work. The next day, the city notified the contractor that she had won the bid to build the school. The contractor was forced to find another company to do the insulation work. The other company charged the contractor $30,000 to do the insulation. Which of the following arguments best supports the claim for $5,000 by the contractor against the insulation company?

A) The contractor had made an offer to the insulation company that the latter accepted when it submitted its bid.
B) The insulation company had made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city.
C) The insulation company's bid was an offer that it was obligated to hold open, because the insulation company and the contractor were merchants.

A large privately owned and operated shopping mall is open to the public and includes small shops, major department stores, and restaurants that are located around a pedestrian area. It also has several movie theaters, an ice-skating rink, a small amusement park, and a branch of the local public library. The mall is advertised as ""a small town with a big-town feel."" During shopping hours, a group of 10 protesters gathered in the pedestrian area near the entrance to a department store to denounce the sale of animal fur products in that store. The protesters were peaceful and did not interfere with traffic into or out of the store, but they carried signs and vocally communicated their message to people walking in the area. Mall management quickly broke up the protest and required the protesters to leave the mall. The protesters have sued the mall, claiming that their right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was violated. Should the protesters prevail?

A) No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.
B) No, because the prohibition of protests adjacent to the entrance of a department store during shopping hours is a constitutionally proper limitation on the time, place, and manner of speech.
C) Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.
D) Yes, because the mall's restriction on the protesters' speech was broader than necessary to ensure proper access to the department store.

Mall management quickly broke up the protest and required the protesters to leave the mall. The protesters have sued the mall, claiming that their right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was violated. Should the protesters prevail?

A) No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.
B) No, because the prohibition of protests adjacent to the entrance of a department store during shopping hours is a constitutionally proper limitation on the time, place, and manner of speech.
C) Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.
D) Yes, because the mall's restriction on the protesters' speech was broader than necessary to ensure proper access to the department store.

A police car drove alongside the student and, hearing the loud and raucous music; the police officers arrested the student and charged him with violating the anti- noise statute. Before the student was brought to trial, the highest court in the state ruled the statute unconstitutional as vague and overbroad. As a result, the charges against the student were dropped, and his case was dismissed. Thereafter, the district attorney's office decided to prosecute the student for violating a state attempt statute. The attempt statute provided that legal impossibility was no defense. Thereupon, the student was charged with attempting to violate the anti-noise statute. At trial, the student took the stand to testifi on his own behalf. He testified that when he was arrested, he had purposely turned up the stereo to its highest level because his favorite song was playing. Will the student be found guilty of violating the attempt statute?

A) Yes, because he possessed the requisite intent.

3540,Professional Law,Very Rude,"You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this? A state criminal law prohibits the publication of any description of the details of the execution of any prisoner who is sentenced to death by the courts of the state. Although the law allows a specified number of reporters to observe an execution, only the prison warden's official statement that the prisoner was ""executed as provided by law"" at a certain time and date may be published. The purpose of the law is to protect the public, particularly children, from the details of executions. After a particular execution was mishandled, causing the prisoner to suffer, a newspaper in the state published a story describing the event in detail. The story was written by the newspaper's reporter, who was permitted to observe the execution but did not promise prison officials that he would report only the warden's official statement. A prosecutor subsequently filed charges against the newspaper for publishing the details of the execution in violation of the state law. Is this prosecution constitutional?

A) No, because the prosecution seeks to punish the publication of lawfully obtained, truthful information about a matter of public significance, without adequate justification.
B) No, because the reporter did not promise prison officials that he would report only the warden's official statement about the execution.
C) Yes, because publication of the details of such events might cause psychological damage to some children.
D) Yes, because the newspaper should have brought an action to test the validity of the law before publishing the reporter's story.

3541,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A woman is engaged in the retail sale of widgets throughout the United States. On March 7, the woman sent the following purchase order to a manufacturer of widgets:""Promptly ship 1,000 widgets, catalogue #B4-IEU, at the current wholesale price to our warehouse. Thank you for your attention to this matter. ""This order was received by the manufacturer on March 9. The next day, the manufacturer replied by fax:""Your order has been received.

A) Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.
B) Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.
C) Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.

One car stopped in traffic was creating a distraction by blasting rap music. A police officer told the driver to turn it down, which he did. While explaining this, the officer spotted a handgun next to the driver on the seat. State law allowed the carrying of a concealed or unconcealed weapon. The officer ordered him out of the car for safety concerns. The officer drew her gun and pointed it at him as he got out, threatening to shoot him if he was not compliant. Other officers approached with weapons drawn. The driver was put on the ground and handcuffed. Drugs were found inside the car and he was charged with drug possession. He filed a motion to suppress, claiming a Fourth Amendment violation. What is the most likely decision of the court?

A) The driver was acting erratically by blasting music in the middle of an auto accident investigation, and when a gun was spotted this justified a custodial interrogation and a search of the car.
B) The officer had a right to separate the driver from the gun, and the ensuing procedures and search were reasonably calculated to protect the officers and the other motorists.
C) The officer in effect overreacted to the initial purpose of the stop, and initiated an arrest procedure without probable cause to do so, and thus the drugs will be suppressed.

3565,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A federal statute governing food stamp fraud makes it a crime to knowingly acquire or possess food coupons in a manner not authorized by the statute or the regulations. A grocery store owner purchased discounted food stamps from an undercover agent, and was arrested for violating the statute. At trial, the store owner claimed that the government must prove that he had the specific intent to commit a crime. The government contended it only had to show that he knowingly acquired food stamps, and that this was not a specific intent crime. The trial judge adopted the government's interpretation, and the store owner was convicted. His appeal made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Will the Court likely reverse or affirm the conviction and why?

A) Conviction reversed, because a store owner is exempt from the statute, which applies only to consumers who use food stamps illegally.
B) Conviction reversed, because the better interpretation is that mens rea is included, and the owner must know his conduct is in violation of the criminal laws.
C) Conviction affirmed, because the meaning of knowingly does not connote that there must be specific knowledge by the actor that what he is doing is illegal.
D) Conviction affirmed, because the modern trend of the law is to recognize criminal liability without mens rea or specific criminal intent.

A) Conviction reversed, because a store owner is exempt from the statute, which applies only to consumers who use food stamps illegally.
B) Conviction reversed, because the better interpretation is that mens rea is included, and the owner must know his conduct is in violation of the criminal laws.
C) Conviction affirmed, because the meaning of knowingly does not connote that there must be specific knowledge by the actor that what he is doing is illegal.
D) Conviction affirmed, because the modern trend of the law is to recognize criminal liability without mens rea or specific criminal intent.

In September 1989, the doctor executed a warranty deed conveying the timberland property to a dentist in fee simple. The dentist recorded immediately in the Grantor Grantee Index. Then in April 1990, the dentist conveyed the same tract to a buyer in fee simple by warranty deed. The buyer paid full market value and recorded the deed at once in the Grantor Grantee Index. The land in question had never been occupied, fenced, or cleared except that between the years 1986 2010, a mining company, one mile from the property, regularly drove trucks over a cleared path pursuant to a 1986 agreement with the doctor. The agreement, which was duly recorded, provided that ""the parties expressly agree and the doctor promises that the doctor and his successors shall refrain from obstructing the said described pathway across the doctor's land, which the mining company and its successors may perpetually use as a road, in consideration of which the mining company and its successors will pay the sum of $700 per annum. ""In 1990, after the conveyance from the dentist, the buyer informed the mining company that he would no longer honor the 1986 agreement permitting the mining company to use the pathway. The mining company brought an action for specific performance. Judgment should be for

A) the mining company, because their property interest would ""run with the land. ""
B) the mining company, because the possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners.
C) the buyer, because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance.

She felt some movement and snapped awake to see a man taking the baby from the stroller. The man was large and menacing-looking. The babysitter, who is thin and petite, froze and did not put up a struggle as the man stated, ""I will kill you if you move."" The babysitter did scream and call for help as the kidnapper fled with the child. Within a few yards he tripped and dropped the baby on its head. The baby died at the hospital of massive head injuries. Is it probable that the prosecutor will charge the babysitter with a crime, and if so, what will be the charge?

A) Yes, this is felony murder in that the babysitter's unacceptable behavior was committed during the commission of the kidnapping felony.
B) No, the babysitter did not commit a criminal act under the circumstances  her negligence was not gross enough to rise to the level of criminality and she had no criminal intent.
C) No, because she did not do anything wrong in dozing off and she had no duty to protect the baby at the expense of her own life.
D) Yes, she would be charged with negligent homicide because it was foreseeable that if she fell asleep for even just a few seconds, the baby would likely be kidnapped and killed.

B) No, the babysitter did not commit a criminal act under the circumstances  her negligence was not gross enough to rise to the level of criminality and she had no criminal intent.
C) No, because she did not do anything wrong in dozing off and she had no duty to protect the baby at the expense of her own life.
D) Yes, she would be charged with negligent homicide because it was foreseeable that if she fell asleep for even just a few seconds, the baby would likely be kidnapped and killed.

3608,Professional Law,Very Rude,"You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this? A teenage girl was babysitting a two-year-old baby. She took the baby in a stroller to the public park, as she often did. On this day, she negligently ""nodded off"" for just a few seconds on a park bench with the stroller next to her. She felt some movement and snapped awake to see a man taking the baby from the stroller. The man was large and menacing-looking. The babysitter, who is thin and petite, froze and did not put up a struggle as the man stated, ""I will kill you if you move."" The babysitter did scream and call for help as the kidnapper fled with the child. Within a few yards he tripped and dropped the baby on its head. The baby died at the hospital of massive head injuries. Is it probable that the prosecutor will charge the babysitter with a crime, and if so, what will be the charge?

3618,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A man owned a four-story apartment building. The man borrowed $125,000 from his friend to make improvements. As consideration for the loan, the man executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the apartment building. The mortgage was dated January 1, 2008, and was recorded January 2, 2008. Thereafter, on February 1, 2008, the man executed a deed absolute on the apartment building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the man then delivered the deed to an escrow agent in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the man failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1, 2009, the man failed to pay the note when it came due. The next day, the escrow agent delivered the deed to the apartment building to the friend. The friend then properly recorded this deed on January 3. One week later, on January 10, the friend conveyed the apartment building by warranty deed to an investor for the purchase price of $200,000. On January 12, the man tendered the $125,000 balance due to the friend, which he refused to accept. The man now brings an appropriate action against the friend and the investor to set aside the conveyance and to permit the redemption of the property by the man. Which of the following best states the man's legal rights, if any, in his action against the friend and the investor?

A) The man has no rights against the investor, but the man does have an action for redemption against the friend for the value of the property.
B) The man has no rights against the friend, but the man does have an action for redemption against the investor for the value of the property.
C) The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but the man cannot set aside the conveyance.

A) It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.
B) It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.
C) It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.

The state adopted the so-called ""disaffiliation"" statute in order to have intraparty feuds resolved in primary elections rather than in the general election. Moreover, the state's elections director strongly supported the law and argued that it was necessary to avoid voter confusion and to ensure that the general election winner received a majority. A man, who was a registered Democrat in 2008, now wishes to run as an independent candidate in the November, 2009, general election. However, the elections director ruled that his candidacy violated the state's ""disaffiliation"" statute and barred him from appearing on the ballot. If the man files suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state's election statute, which of the following best states the burden of persuasion?

A) The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further an important state interest under equal protection analysis.

Under the authority of a federal voting rights statute, some states drew congressional districts in a manner calculated to increase the likelihood that members of historically disadvantaged minority racial groups would be elected. The U.S. Supreme Court declared these districts to be unconstitutional, as improper racial gerrymanders. In response to this ruling, Congress passed a new statute that explicitly denies the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over all future cases challenging the constitutionality of action taken under the authority of the federal voting rights statute. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument for the constitutionality of the new statute restricting the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction?

A) Article III of the Constitution explicitly states that the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction is subject to such exceptions and regulations as Congress shall make.
B) The constitutional principle of separation of powers authorizes Congress to pass statutes calculated to reduce the effects of Supreme Court decisions that interfere with the exercise of powers that have been delegated to the legislative branch.

A retiree, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the retiree and begins formulating plans for constructing single- family dwelling units. The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding ""upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,"" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called tract I. Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be

A) that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.
B) that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.
C) that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.
D) that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.

Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be

A) that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.
B) that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.
C) that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.
D) that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.

3850,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A senator, had been a state senator for three years. During that period of time, it had been his regular practice to stay at a hotel in the state's capital while the legislature was in session (namely from September through March). As a general rule, the senator stayed at the hotel each and every night during that seven-month period. When the senator checked into the hotel on September 1, 2007 for the 2007 2008 term, the hotel manager quoted the senator his usual senatorial discount rate of $50 per night. Although nothing was said regarding payment terms, the senator customarily paid the bill in weekly installments. During the months of September and October, he paid the hotel at the end of each week $350 plus tax and other accumulated expenses. On the last day of October, the senator made his usual weekly payment covering the rental period from October 25 to October 31. Then, on the morning of November 4 (before checkout time for that day), the senator decided to suddenly move out of the hotel and register at a new motel located two blocks away. He notified the manager at the hotel of his intent to check out and tendered a check for $150 plus tax and other incidental charges incurred from November 1 through November 3. When the manager noticed that the senator was paying only for three days, she remarked, ""You still owe us $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and $350 plus taxes for an additional week because you didn't give us a week's notice that you planned to vacate. "" The senator refused to pay the additional charges. If the hotel brings suit against the senator to recover for the unpaid balance, how many additional days lodging will he be required to pay for?

A) None.

A defendant, a 15-year-old, entered the store to purchase a shotgun as a present for her father. She took a shotgun off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for it. Not seeing the cashier anywhere, the defendant left the exact price for the shotgun on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, she should be found

A) guilty, because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age.
B) guilty, because the statute imposes absolute criminal liability.
C) not guilty, provided she was unaware that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to a person in her age group.
D) not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.

The high school is a public school, and the school has a policy that all student athletes are required to sign an authorization form by which they consent to undergo random drug testing. All the basketball players on the school team, except the teenager, signed the authorization. In the third game of the season, the team beat their archrival, and the teenager scored a record high 69 points. In the locker room following the game, the basketball coach approached the teenager and requested that he provide a urine sample for a random drug test. The teenager refused. He had smoked some marijuana the previous day and was afraid that a positive test result might jeopardize his being awarded a basketball scholarship to college. Thereafter, the teenager was suspended from the team for failing to comply with the coach's request. The coach later admitted that he did not have any individualized suspicion that the teenager was under the influence of drugs. The teenager has filed a motion challenging the suspension and seeking reinstatement on the basketball team. The court will most likely rule in favor of

A) the school, because a urine sample does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.
B) the school, because drug testing is not an intrusion on his Fourth Amendment right of privacy.
C) the student, because he didn't consent to the drug test.
D) the student, because the coach admitted that he did not have any individualized suspicion that the student was under the influence of drugs.

3917,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? On March 1, 1999 a widower, the sole owner and occupant of a piece of property, died and devised the property to both his co-worker and his boss ""as their community property. "" The co-worker and the boss were also siblings, and neither was married. The property consisted of a single-family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. During her occupancy, the boss paid $3,500 each year in insurance and property taxes. In addition, the premises on the property had a fair market value during this period of $1,500 each year. Following her mother's death, the boss's daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. As the administratrix of the boss's estate, the daughter sought to collect from the co-worker one- half of the cost of insurance and property taxes that the boss paid. Conversely, the co-worker claimed that he was not liable for any of the expenses. Furthermore, the coworker's attorney advised him that the daughter did not own any interest in the property and that since the boss's death, he (the co-worker) owned the entire property. The attorney also informed the co-worker that the daughter owed him rent for the entire period of her occupancy, and if she continued to occupy the premises, then she would be liable for insurance and property taxes as well. In an appropriate action to determine the title of the property, what, if any, interest does the daughter have in the said property?

A) None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.
B) An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.
C) An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.
D) An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.

A homeowner buys a new leaf blower and is so impressed with its power that he gets carried away and blows large amounts of his work onto the next door neighbor's yard. In addition to leaves, he also blew large amounts of pest-infested plant debris onto the neighbor's property. The material has accumulated into large, unsightly piles and caused damage to the neighbor's healthy plants. He has to pay workers to haul the material away and he incurs expenses to replace infected perennials. The neighbor sues for the tort of trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor cannot prove that homeowner acted with an intent to trespass or to do harm. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?

A) No, because the infected debris constituted an abnormally dangerous condition and homeowner could be held strictly liable for the trespass.
B) No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.
C) Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will.
D) Yes, because the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and did not think that it would accumulate on the neighbor's property.

3932,Professional Law,Neutral,"A homeowner buys a new leaf blower and is so impressed with its power that he gets carried away and blows large amounts of his work onto the next door neighbor's yard. In addition to leaves, he also blew large amounts of pest-infested plant debris onto the neighbor's property. The material has accumulated into large, unsightly piles and caused damage to the neighbor's healthy plants. He has to pay workers to haul the material away and he incurs expenses to replace infected perennials. The neighbor sues for the tort of trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor cannot prove that homeowner acted with an intent to trespass or to do harm. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?

A) No, because the infected debris constituted an abnormally dangerous condition and homeowner could be held strictly liable for the trespass.
B) No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.
C) Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will.
D) Yes, because the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and did not think that it would accumulate on the neighbor's property.

3933,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A student was a practical joker who liked to perform zany antics. Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, ""What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?"" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, ""Study this, baby!"" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

A) Burglary only.
B) Attempted violation of the statute.

The farmer subdivided his property into two 10-acre parcels:Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the major boulevard; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river to the south. In March 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel ito a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Then in September 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. In 1965, the farmer constructed a driveway from what is now Parcel 2, extending over Parcel 1, where it connected with the major boulevard. This driveway lies across what is now Parcel 1 and was used continuously by the farmer until 1997 when he conveyed his property in parcels to the man and the woman. When the woman took possession of Parcel 2, she immediately began to use the drive way across Parcel 1. Thereafter, the man requested that the woman cease to use the driveway over Parcel 1.

4003,Professional Law,Neutral,"A farmer was the owner of a 20-acre tract that was situated just south of a major boulevard, a street that ran east and west. The farmer's tract was located next to an adjacent 300-acre ranch to the east. Immediately to the west of the farmer's parcel was a 100-acre tract. The farmer subdivided his property into two 10-acre parcels:Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the major boulevard; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river to the south. In March 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel ito a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Then in September 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. In 1965, the farmer constructed a driveway from what is now Parcel 2, extending over Parcel 1, where it connected with the major boulevard. This driveway lies across what is now Parcel 1 and was used continuously by the farmer until 1997 when he conveyed his property in parcels to the man and the woman. When the woman took possession of Parcel 2, she immediately began to use the drive way across Parcel 1. Thereafter, the man requested that the woman cease to use the driveway over Parcel 1.

Honestly believing that the $150 still belonged to him, the defendant confronted the victim in the back room and demanded the return of his money. Frightened, the victim handed the money back to the defendant.

B) As two defendants were walking down the street, they noticed a victim park his metallic gold sports car and enter the pool hail. When they approached the car, one of the defendants observed that the victim had left the keys in the ignition. Knowing that the victim would be hustling pool all evening, the defendants hopped into the sports car and drove off, intending to return the car later that evening.
C) During a craps game in the back room of a bar, the defendant lost $150 to the victim. The defendant left the bar after losing his money and returned an hour later with a gun in his possession. Honestly believing that the $150 still belonged to him, the defendant confronted the victim in the back room and demanded the return of his money. Frightened, the victim handed the money back to the defendant.
D) One afternoon, the defendant noticed the victim riding his racing bike in the park. The defendant, who always wanted to own a racing bike, saw his opportunity when the victim left his bike unattended to participate in a touch football game. The defendant jumped on the bike and quickly rode away. Later that evening, the defendant called the victim and demanded $200 for the return of the bike. The victim agreed to the defendant's demand. The following day, the victim paid the defendant the money, and the defendant, in turn, returned the bike.

4065,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A woman had spent many years converting her back yard to an authentic Japanese-style garden. Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman?

A) The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.
B) The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.
C) The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.
D) Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.

The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner.

The man signed an agreement with the facility that he would attend weekly classes at the facility for six months and would pay $500 on the first of each month. Upon signing the contract, the man made his first payment of $500 and attended the weekly class sessions. On the first day of the second month, the man once again made his $500 payment and continued to attend the session. At the start of the third month, the man told the director of the facility's accounting office that he was having financial difficulties, and asked for an extension. The director agreed to permit the man to attend classes while the man tried to get the money to pay the facility. One week later, the man received a letter from the facility informing him that he would be barred from attending any further classes unless the next $500 payment was made. Is the facility justified in refusing to permit the man to attend classes?

A) No, because by permitting the man to attend classes without having paid the third monthly installment, the facility waived its right to have that installment fee paid on time.
B) No, because the facility's allowing the man to attend classes without paying the third monthly installment created an implied contract, thus permitting him to complete the classes without advance payment of the installments.
C) Yes, because the man's failure to make the third monthly installment payment constituted an anticipatory breach.
D) Yes, because there was no consideration to extinguish the payment of the third monthly installment fee, which was a material part of the contract.

One week later, the man received a letter from the facility informing him that he would be barred from attending any further classes unless the next $500 payment was made. Is the facility justified in refusing to permit the man to attend classes?

A) No, because by permitting the man to attend classes without having paid the third monthly installment, the facility waived its right to have that installment fee paid on time.
B) No, because the facility's allowing the man to attend classes without paying the third monthly installment created an implied contract, thus permitting him to complete the classes without advance payment of the installments.
C) Yes, because the man's failure to make the third monthly installment payment constituted an anticipatory breach.
D) Yes, because there was no consideration to extinguish the payment of the third monthly installment fee, which was a material part of the contract.

4189,Professional Law,Very Rude,"You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this? A construction company, in preparing its bid for the construction of a new hospital, received a quotation of $120,000 from a subcontractor who offered to do the kitchen work in the new hospital. This bid was $30,000 lower than the construction company's next lowest bid for the kitchen work. As a result, the construction company lowered its bid by $20,000 before submitting it to the hospital board. After the construction company was awarded the construction bid and had accepted the subcontractor's offer, the subcontractor discovered that in his preparation of the quotation, he had overlooked some subsidiary kitchen installments required by the plans. Immediately thereafter, the subcontractor brought suit for rescission of the contract. It should

4262,Professional Law,Very Rude,"You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this? A newspaper printed an article stating that a local doctor was afflicted with a venereal disease and had volunteered for a program studying the various cures for the disease. The article was false, and was printed without adequate research. The doctor sued the newspaper company, claiming damages per se. The paper defended on the basis that this was a public interest article, that the paper was not reckless or malicious in its investigation and reporting, and that the doctor could not prove any special damages. Will the court adopt the defense reasoning and dismiss the case for failure to state a claim?

A) Yes, the doctor is a professional figure in the community and he must accept the risk of false reporting, especially where he cannot prove any special damages.
B) Yes, the newspaper is allowed to make mistakes as long as there is no malice, and the case must be dismissed as a matter of law.
C) No, this fits the requirements for slander per se and there is a valid claim of malice stated against the paper.
D) No, this fits the requirements for libel per se, which is so inflammatory that the doctor does not have to prove special damages.

4293,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? In 1993, a landowner had good record title toa vineyard in fee simple absolute. In 1994, thelandowner delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000,a deed signed by the landowner, naming the son andhis heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the landowner-to-son deed, sought out the landowner and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the vineyard from the landowner to the farmer and his heirs. The landowner executed such a deed, and the farmer promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the vineyard by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the vineyard. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the vineyard to an investor and, for $15,000, paid by the investor, signed and delivered a deed of the vineyard in favor of the investor and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the investor made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a vintner paid the farmer $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the vintner a deed of the vineyard in favor of the vintner and his heirs. The vintner had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior landowner-to-son instrument. Although the vintner did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the vineyard twice a week. The vintner recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a farmer, the investor signed and delivered a deed of the vineyard naming the farmer and his heirs as grantees. Before the farmer had paid the investor and taken his deed, the farmer visited the vineyard and observed the fence. However, the vintner was not present when the farmer visited the property, and nothing suggested who if anyone was using it. In any case, the farmer did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The farmer then recorded the deed. This jurisdiction uses Grantor  Grantee Indices and has no Tract IndexIn 2008, what is the present state of title to the vineyard if the jurisdiction's recording act provides:""Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded""?

A) In a race notice jurisdiction, the farmer, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he was the last in time to record.
B) In a pure race jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he purchased the property for value and recorded first in time.
C) In a race notice jurisdiction, the vintner, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior landowner-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the vineyard, because he recorded his deed first in time.

One evening armed security officers detained him and accused him of stealing. According to the hotel, the security camera displayed him ""wandering aimlessly"", and at times ""suspiciously"" handling various items offered for sale. They seized the man's paper bags which contained various items sold by the convention vendors; due to being surprised and disoriented, he could not immediately locate his receipts. The officers made him sit on a chair in the hallway until the police arrived 20 minutes later. The man later produced receipts for the items and was released. He sued the hotel for the tort of false imprisonment. Will the court allow the case to go to the jury?

A) No, there was probable cause for an arrest and there can therefore be no false imprisonment.
B) No, the failure to immediately provide receipts gave the security personnel justification to confine him.

A defendant parked his car illegally in a handicapped parking space while he went into a store to get a cup of coffee. The defendant was inside the store waiting for his coffee when a member of the city's parking enforcement department drove by the vehicle. Seeing that there was no handicapped sticker on the car, the parking official stopped and started ticketing the vehicle. When the defendant came outside, he got into an argument with the parking official. After the defendant became verbally abusive, the parking official told him to desist or he was going to impound the vehicle. After the defendant continued his badgering, the parking official told him that he was impounding the vehicle and called the station house for officer assistance. A few minutes later, a police officer arrived on the scene. He asked the defendant for identification and then proceeded to frisk him for weapons. The officer found a clear vial containing heroin in the defendant's back pocket. He then placed the defendant under arrest. Thereupon, the parking official went into the defendant's car and began an inventory search. In this jurisdiction, parking enforcement personnel have statutory authority to conduct inventory searches of impounded vehicles. The parking official did not find anything of interest. After the police officer placed the defendant in the patrol car, the officer asked the parking official if he could search the vehicle, to which the parking official responded yes. The officer looked under the floor mat and found a bag containing marijuana. The defendant was taken to the station house and charged with unlawful possession of heroin and marijuana. Prior to trial, the defense filed a motion to exclude the heroin and marijuana from being admitted into evidence. The motion will be granted with respect to

A) the heroin only.

The pianist could not keep a piano in her apartment because of its small dimensions. In order to practice each day, she had to travel to a school of performing arts to use its musical facilities. Finally, the pianist decided to move out of her apartment and buy a more spacious home, where she could have her own piano. As she was house hunting, the pianist found a quaint home in the county that she wanted. She put a bid down on the home with the seller's broker. She was informed that the owner was in Europe on a business trip and would not be entertaining any offers until he returned. While she was awaiting word on the county property, the pianist's friend orally agreed to sell his piano to her for $8,000. The pianist explained that she wanted the piano only if she should succeed in her efforts to buy the county home. For this reason, the parties agreed that the piano sale would not take effect unless the pianist bought the county home. The next day, the parties reduced their oral agreement to a signed writing, but did not include in the writing any mention that the sale would not take effect unless the pianist bought the county home. Two weeks later, the owner of the county property returned from a trip and rejected the pianist's offer. The friend now brings an action against the pianist for breach of contract to buy the piano. How should the court rule on the pianist's offer to prove, over the friend's objection, that she has not been able to buy the county home?

B) The evidence is admissible, to show frustration of the purpose of the contract.

She was informed that the owner was in Europe on a business trip and would not be entertaining any offers until he returned. While she was awaiting word on the county property, the pianist's friend orally agreed to sell his piano to her for $8,000. The pianist explained that she wanted the piano only if she should succeed in her efforts to buy the county home. For this reason, the parties agreed that the piano sale would not take effect unless the pianist bought the county home. The next day, the parties reduced their oral agreement to a signed writing, but did not include in the writing any mention that the sale would not take effect unless the pianist bought the county home. Two weeks later, the owner of the county property returned from a trip and rejected the pianist's offer. The friend now brings an action against the pianist for breach of contract to buy the piano. How should the court rule on the pianist's offer to prove, over the friend's objection, that she has not been able to buy the county home?

A) The evidence is admissible, to show that the written agreement did not become a contract.
B) The evidence is admissible, to show frustration of the purpose of the contract.
C) The evidence is barred, because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds.
D) The evidence is barred, because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.

His friend had often cautioned him that he should not leave so much of his merchandise out in the open. One day, as the friend entered the store to pay a visit, he decided he'd put his unheeded warnings into action by playing a joke on the owner. The friend took a hatchet that was lying on a display case and swung it over his head as if he were going to strike the owner, who was standing at the register with his back turned. The friend then said, ""All right buddy, one false move and it's over. "" The owner was very frightened at almost being hit with the hatchet but suffered no actual physical or other harm. If the owner asserts a claim against the friend, the most likely result is that he will

A) recover, because the friend was negligent.

C) not recover, because he suffered no physical harm.

To celebrate passing, the graduate went out with a few friends to a popular campus bar. The graduate's friend ordered a round of Hula Girls for everyone. A Hula Girl is an extremely potent alcoholic drink consisting. of 2 ounces of dry gin, 1 ounce of French vermouth, and 1 teaspoon of grenadine. After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass with an inverted lemon peel, which is cut at the ends to represent a grass skirt. Although the graduate had never heard of a Hula Girl, she was in a festive mood and drank it, anyway. A few minutes later, the graduate became very dizzy and attempted to stand up from the barstool. As she tried to walk to the restroom, she became nauseated and vomited over a customer sitting at a nearby table. The customer was embarrassed and greatly humiliated by the incident.

He looked at it thoroughly. The tag on the window indicated a special 30-point inspection was done on the car. The 30 points included the drive train, the engine, spark plugs, oil, transmission, and numerous other major items. The man put a $1,000 down payment on the car. He took the car to an independent mechanic who told him that the car had been in an accident and had sustained severe damage, including a cracked engine block. The mechanic offered that the dealer must have known of that kind of massive damage. The man tried to return the car and get his down payment back, but the dealer refused, claiming the car was sold ""as is,"" and all express or implied warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code were disclaimed in the purchase contract. Stuck with a lemon, the man sued the company under a common law fraud theory. The company counterclaimed for the balance of the purchase price. Will the man likely prevail in the litigation against the car dealer?

A) Yes, because the dealer withheld material information intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the condition of the car.
B) Yes, because the dealer has a duty to give every reason why an ""as is"" car may go bad and to list those reasons on the window.
C) No, because the dealer cannot be held responsible for possible damage that the used car may have developed after years of use.
D) No, because the dealer is absolutely protected when he sells a used car in ""as is"" condition, and where the warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code are duly waived.

4457,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A purchaser signed an agreement of sale to buy real estate. It had a contingency clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?

A) Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.
B) Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval  the first notice communicated is the effective one.
C) No, because the amount of time that he was late was a ""de minimus"" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.
D) No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.

4484,Professional Law,Very Rude,"You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this? A state was facing a fiscal problem. In order to raise funds, the state decided to consider the creation of a state postal service that only its residents may use for intrastate mail. The price for stamps printed by the state postal service would be half the cost of stamps printed by the U. S. Postal Service and would always be guaranteed to arrive within 24 hours. In addition, any employees of the state would be able to send their mail for free through the state postal service. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the proposed legislation?

A) It constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws, because employees of the state receive personal benefits that are not enjoyed by employees of other states.

4491,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A bakery incorporated and headquartered in State A had a dispute with a mill incorporated and headquartered in State B over the quality of the flour the mill had delivered to the bakery. The bakery sued the mill in a federal court in State A for breach of contract, seeking $100,000 in damages. The contract between the bakery and the mill contained a clause designating State B courts as the sole venue for litigating disputes arising under the contract. Under precedent of the highest court in State A, forum-selection clauses are unenforceable as against public policy; under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, such clauses are enforceable. The mill has moved to transfer the case to a federal court in State B, citing the forum-selection clause in the parties' contract and asserting the facts that the flour was produced in State B and that the majority of likely witnesses are in State B. Is the court likely to grant the mill's motion?

A) No, because State A law treats forum- selection clauses as unenforceable.
B) No, because the mill should have instead filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue.
C) Yes, because federal common law makes the forum-selection clause controlling.
D) Yes, because federal law governs transfers of venue, and it would be more convenient for the witnesses and parties to litigate the claim in State B.

4493,Professional Law,Very Friendly,"Would you be so kind as to solve the following question? A recent law school graduate took and passed the bar examination. Before the swearing-in ceremony, however, the graduate received a letter from the bar examiners indicating that his admission would be delayed until a character fitness investigation had been completed. The examiners also requested information as to whether the graduate had ever been arrested, convicted, or placed on probation for a criminal offense. The graduate had been arrested as a juvenile for possession of marijuana. He was placed in a special drug education program for first- time juvenile offenders and was told that the arrest would be expunged. Since the graduate believed that he had been totally exonerated of criminal liability, he didn't report the arrest on his bar application form. The bar examiners had, in fact, received an anonymous letter making reference to the graduate's juvenile arrest and suggesting that he was not morally fit to be admitted as an attorney. In addition, the letter provided detailed information about the facts related to the offense. As a result, the examiners hired a special investigator, to look into the matter. As part of the investigator's inquiry, he went to the clerk of the juvenile court where the offense occurred and demanded access to the records concerning the graduate. The clerk refused, citing a state statute that required all court and police records relating to juveniles be sealed. After all other attempts to gain access to the records proved futile, the bar examiners filed suit in federal district court demanding access to the relevant documents. The court should rule that, as applied to this case, the state statute regarding the sealing of juvenile records is

A) constitutional, because juveniles are entitled to the equal protection of the laws.
B) constitutional, because the state has a strong and legitimate interest in rehabilitating juvenile offenders, and this is furthered by protecting them from embarrassment in later life through revelation ofjuvenile offenses.
C) unconstitutional, because the bar examiners, as a quasi-judicial agency, is entitled to haveaccess to all relevant public documents.
D) unconstitutional, because it hinders the interests of justice by preventing the bar examiners from determining the fitness of candidates to practice law.
